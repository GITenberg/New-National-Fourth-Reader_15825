<p>It is thought that the following special features of this book
will commend themselves to Teachers and School Officers.</p>
<p><b><i>The reading matter of the book is more of a descriptive
than conversational style,</i></b> as it is presumed that the
pupil, after having finished the previous books of the series,
will have formed the habit of easy intonation and distinct
articulation.</p>
<p><b><i>The interesting character of the selections</i>,</b> so
unlike the reading books of former times.</p>
<p><b><i>The large amount of information</i></b> which has been
combined with incidents of an interesting nature, to insure the
pupil's earnest and thoughtful attention.</p>
<p><b><i>The length of the selections for reading</i>,</b>-the
attention of pupils being held more readily by long selections
than by short ones, though of equal interest.</p>
<p><b><i>The gradation of the lessons</i>,</b> which has been
systematically maintained by keeping a careful record of all new
words as fast as they appeared, and using only such pieces as
contained a limited number.</p>
<p><b><i>The simplicity of the lessons</i>,</b> which becomes
absolutely necessary in the schools of to-day, owing to the short
school life of the pupil, his immature age, and inability to
comprehend pieces of a metaphysical or highly poetical
nature.</p>
<p><b><i>The ease with which pupils may pass from the Third
Reader of this series to this book</i>,</b> thereby avoiding the
necessity of supplementary reading before commencing the Fourth
Reader, or of using a book of another series much lower in
grade.</p>
<p><b><i>Language Lessons</i></b>, of a nature to secure
intelligent observation, and lead the pupil to habits of thought
and reflection. Nothing being done for the learner that he could
do for himself.</p>
<p><b><i>Directions for Reading</i></b>, which accompany the
lessons-specific in their treatment and not of that general
character which young teachers and pupils are unable to
apply.</p>
<p><b><i>All new words of special difficulty, at the heads of the
lessons</i>,</b> having their syllabication, accent, and
pronunciation indicated according to Webster. Other new words are
placed in a vocabulary at the close of the book.</p>
<p><b><i>The type of this book, like that of the previous books
of the series, is much larger than that generally used</i>,</b>
for a single reason. Parents, every-where, are complaining that
the eye-sight of their children is being ruined by reading from
small, condensed type. It is confidently expected that this
large, clear style will obviate such unfortunate results.</p>
<p><b><i>The illustrations have been prepared regardless of
expense</i>,</b> and will commend themselves to every person of
taste and refinement.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img alt="suggestions to teachers" src=
"images/011.jpg" height="303" width="600" /></div>
<br />
<br />
<p>The following suggestions are submitted for the benefit of
young teachers.</p>
<p>In order that pupils may learn how to define words at the
heads of the lessons, let the teacher read the sentences
containing such words and have pupils copy them upon slate or
paper.</p>
<p>Then indicate what words are to be defined, and insist upon
the proper syllabication, accent, marking of letters, etc.</p>
<p>In this way the pupil learns the meaning of the word as it is
used, and not an abstract definition that may be meaningless.</p>
<p>Have pupils study their reading lessons carefully before
coming to recitation.</p>
<p>The position of pupils while reading should be erect, easy,
and graceful.</p>
<p>Give special attention to the subject of articulation, and
insist upon a clear and distinct enunciation.</p>
<p>In order to develop a clear tone of voice, let pupils
practice, in concert, upon some of the open vowel sounds, using
such words as <b><i>arm, all, old</i></b>.</p>
<p>In this exercise, the force of utterance should be gentle at
first, and the words repeated a number of times; then the force
should be increased by degrees, until "calling tones" are
used.</p>
<p>Encourage a natural use of the voice, with such modulations as
may be proper for a correct rendering of the thoughts which are
read.</p>
<p>It should, be remembered that the development of a good tone
of voice is the result of careful and constant practice.</p>
<p>Concert reading is recommended as a useful exercise, inasmuch
as any feeling of restraint or timidity disappears while reading
with others.</p>
<p>Question individual pupils upon the manner in which lessons
should be read. In this way they will learn to think for
themselves.</p>
<p>Do not interrupt a pupil while reading until a thought or
sentence is completed, since such a course tends to make reading
mechanical and deprive it of expression.</p>
<p>Errors in time, force of utterance, emphasis, and inflection
should be carefully corrected, and then the passage read over
again.</p>
<p>The "Directions for Reading" throughout the book are intended
to be suggestive rather than exhaustive, and can be added to as
occasion requires.</p>
<p>The "Language Lessons" in this book, should not be neglected.
They contain only such matter as is necessary to meet the
requirements of pupils.</p>
<p>Words and expressions not readily understood, must be made
intelligible to pupils. This has been done in part by
definitions, and in part by interpreting some of the difficult
phrases.</p>
<p>After the habit of acquiring the usual meaning has been
formed, the original meaning of those words which are made up of
stems modified by prefixes or affixes should be shown.</p>
<p>The real meaning of such words can be understood far better by
a study of their formation, than by abstract definitions. It will
be found, also, that pupils readily become interested in this
kind of work.</p>
<p>As the capabilities of classes of the same grade will differ,
it may sometimes occur that a greater amount of language work can
be done effectively than is laid down in this book. When this
happens, more time can be devoted to such special kinds of work
as the needs of the classes suggest.</p>
<p>Constant drill upon the analysis of lessons, varied at times
by the analysis of short stories taken from other sources and
read to the class, will develop the reasoning faculties of pupils
and render the writing of original compositions a comparatively
easy exercise.</p>
<p>Encourage the habit of self-reliance on the part of pupils.
Original investigation, even if followed at first by somewhat
crude results, is in the end more satisfactory than any other
course.</p>
<p>The Definitions (pages 373-382) and the List of Proper Names
(pages 383 and 384) may be used in the preparation of the
lessons.<a name="FNanchor_01_1" id="FNanchor_01_1"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_01_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>
<p>When exercises are written, particular care should be required
in regard to penmanship, correct spelling, punctuation, and
neatness.</p>

<h3>"I'M GOING TO."&mdash; PART I.</h3>
<p>Once upon a time, there was a little boy, whose name was
Johnny. "Johnny," said his mamma, one day, "will you bring me an
armful of wood?"</p>
<p>"Yes," said Johnny, "I'm going to"; but just then he heard
Carlo, the dog, barking at a chipmunk over in the meadow, so he
ran off as fast as he could go.</p>
<p>Now this was not the first time that Johnny had said to his
mamma, "Yes, I'm going to." He never thought of that wood again
until about dinner-time, when he began to feel hungry.</p>
<p>When he got back, he found that dinner was over, and papa and
mamma had gone to ride. He found a piece of bread and butter, and
sat down on a Large rock, with his back against the stump of a
tree, to eat it.</p>
<p>When it was all gone, Johnny began to think what he should do
next. He closed his eyes as people are apt to do when they
think.</p>
<p>Presently he heard a score of voices about him. One was
saying, "Wait a bit"; another, "Pretty soon"; another, "In a
minute"; another, "By and by"; and still another, louder than the
rest, kept screaming as loud as it could, "Going to, going to,
going to," till Johnny thought they were crazy.</p>
<p>"Who in the world are you?" said he, in great surprise, "and
what are you making such a noise about?"</p>
<p>"We are telling our names," said they; "didn't you ask us to
tell our names?"</p>
<p>"No," said Johnny, "I didn't."</p>
<p>"O what a story!" cried they all in a breath.</p>
<div class="figright"><img alt="017 (64K)" src="images/017.jpg"
height="500" width="384" /></div>
<p>"Let's shake him for it," said one.</p>
<p>"No, let us carry him to the king," said another.</p>
<p>So they began to spin about him like so many spiders; for each
one of them carried a long web, and when that gets wound around a
boy or a girl, it is a very difficult thing to get rid of.</p>
<p>In a few minutes they had him all wound up&mdash;hands and
feet, nose and eyes, all tied up tight. Then they took him among
them, and flew away with him, miles and miles, over the hills,
and up to a big cave in the mountain. There he heard ever so many
more voices, and it was noisier than ever.</p>
<p>"Where am I?" he said, as soon as he could speak.</p>
<p>"O you're safe at home," answered Wait-a-bit, for he seemed to
be the spokesman; "and they have been expecting you for some
time."</p>
<p>"This isn't my home," said Johnny, feeling very miserable and
beginning to cry.</p>
<p>"O yes, it is," said a chorus of voices. "This is just where
such folks as you belong. There are many of your fellows here,
and you won't be lonesome a bit."</p>
<p>They had begun to unwind the web from his eyes now, so he
opened them and looked about him. O what a wretched place it
was!</p>
<p>Against the sides of the cave, stood long rows of boys and
girls, with very sorry faces, all of them saying over as fast as
they could speak, "Going to, going to!" "Wait a bit, wait a bit!"
"Pretty soon, pretty soon!" "In a minute, in a minute!" studying
the names just as hard as if they were lessons.</p>
<p>There were Delays, and Tardys, and Put-offs, with ever so many
more; and in a corner by themselves, and looking more unhappy
than all the rest, were the poor little fellows whose names were
"Too late."</p>

<h3>"I'M GOING TO."&mdash; PART II.</h3>
<p>"O dear, dear! Where am I?" said Johnny in despair. "Please
let me out! I want my mamma!"</p>
<p>"No, you don't," said Wait-a-bit. "You don't care much about
her, and this is really where you belong. This is the kingdom of
Procrastination, and yonder comes the king."</p>
<p>"The kingdom of what?" said Johnny, who had never heard such a
long word in his life before.</p>
<p>But just then he heard a heavy foot-fall, and a great voice
that sounded like a roar, saying, "Has he come? Did you get
him?"</p>
<p>"Yes, here he is," said Wait-a-bit, "and he'd just been saying
it a little while before we picked him up."</p>
<p>Johnny looked up and saw a monstrous giant, with a bright
green body and red legs, and a yellow head and two horrid
coal-black eyes.</p>
<p>"Let me have him," said the giant. So he took him up just as
if he had been a rag-baby, and looked him all over, turning him
from side to side, and from head to feet.</p>
<p>O but Johnny was frightened, and expected every moment to be
swallowed!</p>
<p>"Let's see," said the giant; "he always says 'Pretty soon.'
No, that isn't it. What is it, my fine fellow, that you always
say to your mamma when she asks you to do any thing for her?</p>
<p>"It isn't 'Pretty soon,' nor 'In a minute.' What is it? They
all mean about the same thing, to be sure, and bring every body
to me in the end; but I must know exactly, or I can't put you in
the right place."</p>
<p>Johnny hung his head, and did not want to tell; but an extra
hard poke of the giant's big finger made him open his mouth and
say with shame, that he always said, "I'm going to."</p>
<p>"O that's it!" said the giant. "Well, then, you stand
there."</p>
<p>So he unwound a bit of the web from his fingers&mdash;just
enough so that he could hold the Procrastinator's
Primer&mdash;and stood him at the end of a long row of children,
who were saying over and over again, just as fast as they could
speak, "Going to, going to, going to, going to," just that, and
nothing else in the world.</p>
<p>Johnny was tired and hungry by this time, and longed to see
his mamma, thinking that, if he could only get back: to her, he
would always mind the very moment she told him to do any
thing.</p>
<p>He made a great many good resolutions while he stood there. At
last the giant called him to come and say his lesson.</p>
<p>"You shall have a short one to-day," said he, "and need say it
only a thousand times, because it is your first day here.
To-morrow, you must say it a million."</p>
<p>Johnny tried to step forward, but the web was still about his
feet, so he fell with, a bang to the floor.</p>
<p>Just then he opened his eyes to find that he had rolled from
the rock to the grass, and that mamma was calling him in a loud
voice to come to supper, and this time he didn't say, "I'm going
to."</p>

<h3>THE BEAN AND THE STONE.</h3>
<p>"I think I ought to be doing something in the world!" said a
little voice out in the garden.</p>
<p>"Pray, what can you do?" asked another and somewhat stronger
voice.</p>
<p>"I think I can grow," answered the little voice.</p>
<p>If you had seen the owner of the little voice, perhaps you
would not have thought him any thing remarkable.</p>
<p>It is true he had on a clean white coat, so smooth and shining
that it looked as if it had been newly starched and ironed, and
inside of this, he hugged two stout packages.</p>
<p>The coat had only one fastening; but that fastening extended
down the back, and was a curious thing to see.</p>
<p>It looked just as if the coat had been cut with a knife, and
had afterward grown together again. It was like a scar on your
hand; and a scar it is called.</p>
<p>"Yes, I ought to be growing," said the little voice, "for I am
a bean, and in the spring a bean ought to grow."</p>
<p>Now you know how the coat came by its scar, for the scar was
the spot which showed where the bean had been broken from the
pod.</p>
<p>"What do you mean by growing?" said the other voice, which
came from a large red stone.</p>
<p>"Why," said the bean, "don't you know what growing means?
I thought every thing knew
how to grow. You see, when I grow, my root goes down into the
soil to get moisture, and my stem goes up into the light to find
heat. Heat and moisture are my food and drink.</p>
<p>"By and by, I shall be a full-grown plant, and that is
wonderful! In the ground, my roots will travel far and wide.</p>
<p>"In the air, how happy my stem will be! I shall learn a great
deal, and see beautiful things every day. O how I long for that
time to come!"</p>
<p>"What you say is very strange," said the red stone. "Here I
have been in this same place for many years, and I have not grown
at all. I have no root; I have no stem; or, if I have, they never
move upward nor downward, as you say. Are you sure you are not
mistaken?"</p>
<p>"Why, of course I'm not mistaken," cried the bean. "I feel
within myself that I can grow; and I have absorbed so much
moisture that I must soon begin."</p>
<p>Just then the bean's coat split from end to end, and for one
or two minutes neither the stone nor the bean spoke. The stone
was astonished, and the bean was a little frightened. However, he
soon recovered his courage.</p>
<p>"There!" said he, showing the two packages he had been
carrying; "these are my seed-leaves. In them is the food on which
I intend to live when I begin growing.</p>
<p>"When my stem is strong enough to do without them, they will
wither away. My coat is all worn-out, too. I shall not need it
any longer. Look inside the seed-leaves, and you will see the
germ. Part of it is root, and part of it is stem. Do you
see?"</p>
<p>"I see two little white lumps," replied the stone; "but I can
not understand how they will ever be a root and a stem."</p>
<p>"I do believe you are a poor, dull mineral, after all," said
the bean; "and if so, of course you can not understand what pleasure a
vegetable has in growing.</p>
<p>"I wouldn't be a mineral for the world! I would not lie still
and do nothing, year after year. I would rather spread my
branches in the sunshine, and drink in the sweet spring air
through my leaves."</p>
<p>"What you say must be all nonsense," said the stone. "I can't
understand it."</p>
<p>But the bean grew on without minding him. The roots pushed
down into the soil and drank up the moisture from the ground.
Then this moisture went into the stem, and the stem climbed
bravely up into the light.</p>
<p>"How happy I am!" cried the bean.</p>
<p>It ran over the red stone, and clasped it with long green
branches, covered with white bean flowers.</p>
<p>"O indeed!" said the stone. "Is this what you call growing? I
thought you were only in fun. How handsome you are!"</p>
<p>"May I hang my pods on you, so that they can ripen in the
sun?" said the bean.</p>
<p>"Certainly, friend," said the stone.</p>
<p>He was very polite, now that he saw the bean was a
full-grown</p>

<div class="stanza">
<p>He was too young&mdash;this little elf&mdash;</p>

<h3>AN ADVENTURE WITH DUSKY WOLVES.&mdash;PART I.</h3>
<p>"During the summer and winter, we had several adventures in
the trapping and killing of wild animals. One of them was of such
a singular and dangerous kind, that you may feel interested in
hearing it.</p>
<p>"It occurred in the dead of winter, when there was snow upon
the ground. The lake was frozen over, and the ice was as smooth
as glass. We spent much of our time in skating about over its
surface, as the exercise gave us health and a good appetite.</p>
<p>"Even Cudjo, our colored servant, had taken a fancy for this
amusement, and was a very good skater. Frank was fonder of it
than the rest of us, and was, in fact, the best skater among
us.</p>
<p>"One day, however, neither Cudjo nor I had gone out, but only
Frank and Harry. The rest of us were busy at some carpenter work
within doors.</p>
<p>"We could hear the merry laugh of the boys, and the ring of
their skates as they glided over the smooth ice. All at once, a
cry reached our ears, which we knew meant the presence of some
danger.</p>
<p>"'O Robert!' cried my wife, 'they have broken through the
ice!'</p>
<p>"We all dropped what we held in our hands, and rushed to the
door. I seized a rope as I ran, while Cudjo took his long spear,
thinking it might be of use to us. This was the work of a moment,
and the next we were outside the house.</p>
<p>"What was our astonishment to see both the boys, away at the
farthest end of the lake, but skating toward us as fast as they
could!</p>
<p>"At the same time, our eyes rested upon a terrible sight. Close
behind them upon the ice, and following at full gallop, was a
pack of wolves!</p>
<p>"They were not the small prairie wolves, which either of the
boys might have chased with a stick, but of a species known as
the 'Great Dusky Wolf' of the Rocky Mountains.</p>
<p>"There were six of them in all. Each of them was twice the size
of the prairie wolf, and their long, dark bodies, gaunt with
hunger, and crested from head to tail with a high, bristling
mane, gave them a most fearful appearance.</p>
<p>"They ran with their ears set back and their jaws apart, so
that we could see their red tongues and white teeth.</p>
<p>"We did not stop a moment, but rushed toward the lake. I threw
down the rope, and seized hold of a large rail as I ran, while
Cudjo hurried forward armed with a spear. My wife, with presence
of mind, turned back into the house for my rifle.</p>
<p>"I saw that Harry was foremost, and that the fierce wolves were
fast closing upon Frank. This was strange, for we knew that Frank
was by far the better skater. We all called out to him, uttering
loud shouts of encouragement. Both were bearing themselves
manfully, but Frank was most in danger.</p>
<p>"The wolves were upon his heels! 'O they will kill him!' I
cried, expecting the next moment to see him thrown down upon the
ice. What was my joy at seeing him suddenly wheel and dart off in
a new direction.</p>

<h3>AN ADVENTURE WITH DUSKY WOLVES.&mdash;PART II.</h3>
<p>"The wolves, thus nimbly eluded, now kept on after Harry, who,
in turn, became the object of our anxiety.</p>
<p>"In a moment they were close upon him; but he, already warned
by his brother, wheeled in a similar manner, while the fierce
brutes, swept along by the force of their running, were carried a
long distance upon the ice before they could turn themselves.</p>
<p>"Their long, bushy tails, however, soon enabled them to turn
about and follow in the new direction, and they galloped after
Harry, who was now the nearest to them.</p>
<p>"Frank, in the meantime, had again turned, and came sweeping
past behind them, at the same time shouting loudly, as if to
tempt them away from their pursuit of Harry.</p>
<p>"They heeded him not, and again he changed his direction, and,
as though he was about to skate into their midst, followed the
wolves.</p>
<p>"This time he skated up close behind them, just at the moment
when Harry had turned again, and thus made his second escape.</p>
<p>"At this moment, we heard Frank calling out to his brother to
make for the shore, while, instead of retreating himself, he
stopped until Harry had passed, and then dashed off, followed
closely by the whole pack.</p>
<p>"Another slight turn brought him nearly in our direction; but
there was a large hole broken through the ice close by the shore,
and we saw that, unless he turned again, he would skate into
it.</p>
<p>"We thought he was watching the wolves too intently to see it,
and we shouted to warn him. Not so; he knew better than we what
he was about.</p>
<p>"When he had reached within a few feet of the hole, he wheeled
sharply to the left, and came dashing up to the point where we
stood to receive him.</p>
<div class="figright"><img alt="wolves(66K)" src="images/036.jpg"
height="500" width="375" /></div>
<p>"The wolves, too intent upon their chase to see any thing else,
went sweeping past the point where he had turned, and the next
moment plunged through the broken ice into the water.</p>
<p>"Then Cudjo and I ran forward, shouting loudly, and, with the
heavy rail and the long spear, commenced dealing death among
them.</p>
<p>"It was but a short, though exciting scene. Five of them were
speared and drowned, while the sixth crawled out upon the ice and
was rapidly making off, frightened enough at his cold
ducking.</p>
<p>"At that moment I heard the crack of a rifle and saw the wolf
tumble over.</p>
<p>"On turning round I saw Harry with, my rifle, which my wife had
brought down and handed to him, as a better marksman than
herself.</p>
<p>"The wolf, only wounded, was kicking furiously about on the
ice; but Cudjo now ran out, and, after a short struggle, finished
the business with his spear.</p>
<p>"This was, indeed, a day of great excitement in our forest
home. Frank, who was the hero of the day, although he said
nothing, was no doubt not a little proud of his skating feat.</p>
<p>"And well he might be, as, but for his skill, poor Harry would
no doubt have fallen a prey to the fierce wolves."</p>

<h3>OUR SAILOR CAT.</h3>
<p>She was a sailor cat, indeed, and it was a sailor who first
brought her on board.</p>
<p>Our steamer was lying at her pier in the North River, at New
York, taking in cargo.</p>
<p>One of our men, who had been ashore, came back with a little
gray-and-white kitten in his arms. She was very poor and thin,
and her little furry coat was sadly soiled with dirt and
grease.</p>
<p>But she had not lost all her fun, for she was making play with
her tiny fore-paws at the ends of the sailor's red beard, to
honest Jack's great delight.</p>
<p>"Where did you pick that up, Jack?" asked the third
officer.</p>
<p>"Well, your honor," said Jack Harmon, touching his cap with a
grin, "seems to me she must have left her ship and gone to look for
another, for I found her tramping along the pier there, and
mewing as if she was calling out for somebody to show her the
road.</p>
<p>"So I thought that, as we have many rats aboard the old craft,
she would be able to pick up a good living there; and I called to
her, and she came at once, and here she is."</p>
<p>Here she was, sure enough; and as Jack ended his story, she
chimed in with a plaintive little "Me-ow," which said, as plainly
as ever any cat spoke yet, "I'm very cold and hungry, and I do
wish somebody would take me below and give me some food!"</p>
<p>She had not long to wait. Half an hour later she was the
best-fed cat in that part of New York City, and that night she
lay snugly curled up with a good warm blanket over her.</p>
<p>Of course, the first thing to do with an adopted cat is to
give it a name, and Jack Harmon, who was a bit of a wag in his
way, and a great admirer of the monster elephant which was just
then making such a stir in New York, called his new pet
"Jumbo."</p>
<p>Jumbo soon became the pet of the whole crew, and of the
passengers, too, when they came on board, a few days later, for
the voyage back to England.</p>
<p>Before we were half-way across the ocean, the bits of meat or
cake, and bits of white bread soaked in milk, which were being
constantly given her by one and another, had made her look as
round as an apple.</p>
<p>The ladies were never tired of stroking her soft fur and
admiring her dainty white paws, which were now as spotless as
snow. The children romped all day with this new playmate, who
seemed to enjoy the sport quite as much as themselves.</p>
<p>But Jumbo was not content with mere play. She seemed to think
herself bound to do something to "work her passage." Whenever any
of the crew went aloft to take in sail, Jumbo would always climb
up, too, as if to help them.</p>
<p>Jack Harmon was still her favorite, and whenever it came his
turn to stand at the bow and keep watch, there was Jumbo going
backward and forward.</p>
<p>On the eighth night of the voyage, the stars looked dim and
watery, and a low bank of clouds began to rise to windward of us,
just between sea and sky.</p>
<p>The old sailors shook their heads and looked grave, as if they
expected an unusual storm. Suddenly the wind began to blow
strongly upon the starboard quarter, stirring up a cross-sea
which tossed the great ship like a toy.</p>
<p>Nearly all the passengers had gone below, and the few who
remained on deck buttoned their water-proof coats, and held
tightly on by any thing they could seize.</p>
<p>Jack Harmon had shut up his cat below, but poor puss escaped
somehow, for all at once a shrill cry was heard, and there was
Jumbo clinging to a rail, with a great mountain of a wave coming
right down upon her.</p>
<p>Several men sprang toward the spot, but Jack was foremost, and
he had just reached his little pet when down came the great wave
upon them both.</p>
<p>Instantly the whole after-deck was one roaring, foaming
waterfall, the flying spray of which blinded one for a moment.
But when it cleared, there stood our brave Jack&mdash;dripping,
bruised, and bleeding from a cut on the head.</p>
<p>But his little favorite was safe in his arms, and as he came
back with her, such a cheer went up from all who were on deck, as
the old ship had not heard for many a day.</p>
<p>"Let's send round the hat for him," said one of the
passengers.</p>
<p>And the hat was sent around, so successfully that Jack got
enough money to give his poor old mother a happy Christmas, and
still have something left over for himself and Jumbo, who was his
mother's pet ever after.</p>

<h3>THE LION.</h3>
<p>There is, in the appearance of the lion, something both noble
and imposing. Nature has given him wonderful strength and
beauty.</p>
<p>His body, when full grown, is only about seven feet long and
less than four feet high; but his large and shapely head, with
its powerful jaws, his glaring eye, and long, flowing mane, give
him an air of majesty that shows him worthy of the
name&mdash;"King of Beasts."</p>
<p>Yet we are told that a lion will not willingly attack man,
unless first attacked himself or driven by hunger to forget his
habits.</p>
<p>On meeting man suddenly, he will turn, retreat slowly for a
short distance, and then run away.</p>
<p>The lion belongs to the cat family, and his teeth and claws
are similar in form and action to those of the house cat.</p>
<p>His food is the flesh of animals; and so great is his
appetite, that it must require several thousand other animals to
supply one lion with food during his life-time.</p>
<p>His strength is so enormous that he can crush the skull of an
ox with a single blow of his powerful paw, and then grasp it in
his jaws and bound away.</p>
<p>Unless driven by hunger to bolder measures, he will hide in
the bushes, or in the tall reeds along the banks of rivers, and
spring suddenly upon the unlucky animal that chances to come near
him.</p>
<p>Many lions have been captured, and their habits and appearance
carefully studied. Although there is a difference in
color&mdash;some being of a yellowish brown, others of a deep
red, and a few silvery gray&mdash;the general form and appearance
of all lions is the same.</p>
<p>The mane is of a dark brown, or of a dusky color, and the tail
nearly three feet long, with a bunch of hair at the tip.</p>
<p>The lioness, or female lion, is smaller in every way than the
male and has no mane.</p>
<p>It is in the night-time that the lion goes out from his den to
seek for food, and his color is so dark and his movements so
silent, that his presence is not known even at the distance of a
few yards.</p>
<p>These dangerous beasts are no longer found in Europe, although
they lived there in numbers many hundred years ago. It is only in
the deserts and rocky hills of Asia and Africa that they are met
with.</p>
<p>Those who have visited a menagerie, and have seen a lion
within the limits of a narrow iron cage, can form no idea of the
majesty of the brute when roaming about freely on his native
soil.</p>
<p>The voice of the lion is loud and strong. It is likely to
strike terror to the bravest heart.</p>
<p>"It consists," says a well-known writer, "at times of a low,
deep moaning, repeated five or six times, and ending in scarcely
audible sighs; at other times, the forest is startled with loud,
deep-toned, solemn roars, increasing in loudness to the third or
fourth, and then dying away in sounds like distant thunder."</p>

<h3>ADVENTURE WITH A LION.</h3>
<p>The dangers of lion-hunting may be understood from the
following incident, narrated by Livingstone, the famous African
traveler:</p>
<p>""The villagers among whom I was staying were much troubled by
lions, which leaped into their cattle-pens and destroyed their
cows.</p>
<p>"As I knew well that, if one of a number of lions is killed,
the others frequently take the hint and leave that part of the
country, I gave the villagers advice to that end, and, to
encourage them, offered to lead the hunt.</p>
<p>"The lions were found hiding among the rocks on a hill covered
with trees, and about a quarter of a mile in length. The men
circled the hill, and slowly edged in closer and closer, so that
the lions might be completely surrounded.</p>
<p>"Presently one of the natives spied a lion sitting on a piece
of rock, and fired at him, the ball missing the beast and
striking the rock.</p>
<p>"The lion turned, bit like a dog at the spot where the bullet
had struck, and then bounded off to the shelter of the
brushwood.</p>
<p>"Soon I saw another lion in much the same situation as the
former, and, being not more than thirty yards from it, let fly
with both barrels.</p>
<div class="figright"><img alt="lion attack (68K)" src=
"images/052.jpg" height="500" width="397" /></div>
<p>"As the lion was still on its legs, I hastened to reload my
gun; but hearing a sudden and frightful cry from the natives, I
looked up and saw the wounded lion springing upon me.</p>
<p>"I was caught by the shoulder and hurled to the ground.
Growling terribly in my ear, the lion shook me as a dog does a
rat.</p>
<p>"The shock produced a stupor, similar to that which seems to be
felt by a mouse after the first shake of a cat.</p>
<p>"The lion then leaped upon one of the natives who had tried to
shoot at him, and then sprang at the neck of a second native who,
armed with a spear, was rushing to the rescue.</p>
<p>"The exertion was too much for the wounded beast, and so, with
his claws bedded in the spearman's shoulder, he rolled over and
died.</p>
<p>"I had escaped, but with a shoulder so broken as to need an
artificial joint, and with eleven teeth wounds in my arm.</p>
<p>"These wounds were less severe than they would have been, had
not a heavy jacket which I had on, cleansed the teeth of the lion
in their passage. As it was, they were soon cured and gave me no
trouble afterward."</p>

<h3>THE NOBLEST DEED OF ALL.</h3>
<p>A rich Persian, feeling himself growing old, and finding that
the cares of business were too great for him, resolved, to divide
his goods among his three sons, keeping a very small part to
protect him from want in his old age.</p>
<p>The sons were all well satisfied, and each took his share
with thanks, and promised that it should be well and properly
employed. When this important business was thus finished, the
father addressed the sons in the following words:</p>
<p>"My sons, there is one thing which I have not included in the
share of any one of you. It is this costly diamond which you see
in my hand. I will give it to that one of you who shall earn it
by the noblest deed.</p>
<p>"Go, therefore, and travel for three months; at the end of that
time, we will meet here again, and you shall tell me what you
have done."</p>
<p>The sons thereupon departed, and traveled for three months,
each in a different direction. At the end of that time they
returned; and all came together to their father to give an
account of their journey. The eldest son spoke first.</p>
<p>"Father, on my journey a stranger entrusted to me a great
number of valuable jewels, without taking any account of them.
Indeed, I was well aware that he did not know how many the
package contained.</p>
<p>"One or two of them would never have been missed, and I might
easily have enriched myself without fear of detection. But I gave
back the package exactly as I had received it. Was not this a
noble deed?"</p>
<p>"My son," replied the father, "simple honesty cannot be called
noble. You did what was right, and nothing more. If you had acted
otherwise, you would have been dishonest, and your deed would
have shamed you. You have done well, but not nobly."</p>
<p>The second son now spoke. He said: "As I was riding along on
my journey, I one day saw a poor child playing by the shore of a
lake; and just as I rode by, it fell into the water, and was in
danger of being drowned.</p>
<p>"I at once dismounted from my horse, and plunging into the
water, brought it safe to land. All the people of the village
where this happened will tell you that what I say is true. Was it
not a noble action?"</p>
<p>"My son," replied the old man, "you did only what was your
duty. You could hardly have left the child to die without
exerting yourself to save it. You, too, have acted well, but not
nobly."</p>
<p>Then the third son came forward to tell his tale. He said:
"Father, I had an enemy, who for years had done me much harm and
tried to take my life.</p>
<p>"One evening during my journey, I was passing along a
dangerous road which ran beside the summit of a cliff. As I rode
along, my horse started at sight of something in the road.</p>
<p>"I dismounted to see what it was, and found my enemy lying
fast asleep on the very edge of the cliff. The least movement in
his sleep and he must have rolled over and been dashed to pieces
on the rocks below.</p>
<p>"His life was in my hands. I drew him away from the edge and
then woke him, and told him to go on his way in peace."</p>
<p>Then the old Persian cried out with great joy, "Dear son, the
diamond is yours, for it is a noble and godlike thing to help an
enemy and return good for evil."</p>

<h3>THE STORY OF INDIAN SPRING.&mdash;PART I.</h3>
<p>"You want to know why this is called Indian Spring, Robbie? I
will tell you.</p>
<p>"When Mary and I were little girls, father moved
away from our pleasant home on the bank of the Delaware River,
and came to this part of the country. There were five of us:
father, mother, Mary, our dear nurse Lizzie, and I.</p>
<p>"Lizzie was a colored woman, who had lived with us a long time.
She was very handsome, and straight as an arrow. She was a few
years older than mother.</p>
<p>"Grandfather Thorpe, your great grandfather, boys, gave her to
mother when she was married. Your grandfather was a miller. The
old mill that I went to see to-day, was his. It was the first
mill built in this part of Pennsylvania.</p>
<p>"O, this was a beautiful country! my eyes never were tired of
looking out over these mountains and valleys. But I saw that
mother's face was getting thinner and whiter every day; they said
she was homesick, and before we had been in the colony a year, a
grave was made under an elm-tree close by, and that grave was
mother's.</p>
<p>"I thought my heart was broken then, but I soon forgot my
sorrow: I still had father, sister Mary, and Lizzie.</p>
<p>"In this part of Pennsylvania at that time there were very few
white people, and besides our own, there was no other colony
within ten miles. But our people being so near together, and well
armed, felt quite safe.</p>
<p>"Ten miles away on the Susquehanna, was a small village
established by a colony from the north, which was used as a
trading-post. There the friendly Indians often came to trade.</p>
<p>"Father went twice a year to this village to get supplies that
came up the river. He often spoke of Red Feather, an old Indian
warrior. Father liked Red Feather, and he learned to trust him
almost as he would have trusted a white man.</p>
<p>"Time passed on until I was thirteen years old, a tall, strong
girl, and very brave for a girl. I could shoot almost as well as
father.</p>
<p>"Little Mary was very quiet and shy, not like me at all. I
loved fishing, and often went out hunting with father, but she
staid at home with Lizzie, or sat down under the trees by the
spring, watching the shadow of the trees moving in it.</p>
<p>"Our colony had by this time become quite prosperous. A good
many of the settlers had built houses for themselves more like
those they had left behind on the Delaware.</p>
<p>"The spring that I was fourteen, father built this house. The
mill had already been grinding away for two years. We were very
happy when we moved out of our little log cabin into this
pleasant house.</p>
<p>"We had but little furniture, but we had plenty of room. Up to
this time, there had not been much trouble with the Indians, and
though we had often dreaded it, and lived in fear many days at a
time, only four of our men had been killed by them.</p>
<p>"We had trusted many of the friendly Indians, and Red Feather
had frequently spent days at our settlement. He seemed to like
the mill.</p>
<p>"I became quite attached to the old man; but Mary was always
afraid of him, and Lizzie kept her sharp eyes on him whenever he
came into the house. She hated him, and he knew it.</p>
<p>"One beautiful clear morning in August of that year, father
went down to the mill as usual. Lizzie was busy with her work,
and little Mary was playing with some tame doves, when looking
up, I saw Lizzie start suddenly.</p>
<p>"She had seen something in the woods that frightened her.
Without speaking, she went to the door, closed and fastened it,
then turned and looked out of the window. She never told mo what
she saw.</p>
<p>"Father came home early that day; he looked anxious, and I knew
that something troubled him. Without waiting to eat his supper,
he went out, and very soon most of the men of the colony had
gathered round him at the spring."</p>

<h3>THE STORY OF INDIAN SPRING.&mdash;PART II.</h3>
<p>""It was as I had feared; we were in danger of an attack from
the Indians.</p>
<p>"Something had happened at the trading-post to provoke them,
and rouse their thirst for blood. But a quiet night passed by and
the sun shone again over the hills in wonderful beauty.</p>
<p>"Suddenly, there sounded from the forest a scream. I had never
heard it before, but I knew it. It was the terrible war-whoop.
Then all was confusion and horror.</p>
<p>"I saw Nanito, an Indian that I knew, who had eaten at our
table. I saw him strike down our father, while Lizzie fought to
save him.</p>
<p>"But it was no use, there was no mercy in the heart of the
Indian. They carried Lizzie away from us, and we never saw her
again.</p>
<p>"Poor little frightened Mary and I were tied together, our
hands fastened behind us, and we were given, to&mdash;whom do you
think, Robbie?&mdash;to Red Feather. Then I hated him, and
resolved that I would kill him if I could.</p>
<p>"After a while he took us out of the house, and then I saw that
most of the houses in the little village were burning. The women
and children were saved alive, but nearly all the men were
killed.</p>
<p>"I was very quiet, for I wanted my hands untied, and I thought
perhaps Red Feather would pity me and unfasten them.</p>
<p>"Little Mary was frightened nearly to death. She had not spoken
since she saw the Indian strike father down,&mdash;when she
screamed and fell senseless.</p>
<p>"For a good while I thought she was dead. She had revived a
great deal, but had not spoken.</p>
<p>"About sundown Red Feather led us down past the spring, out
into the woods, but not far away. We could still see the smoke
rising from the burning houses. The Indians had gone some
distance farther and camped with the white prisoners.</p>
<p>"Red Feather could speak English, so I told him if he would
untie my hands, I would make his fire, and bake his corn cake for
him.</p>
<p>"He was old and feeble, and had lost much of his natural
cunning. He knew me, and trusted me; so without speaking, he took
his hunting knife from his belt, cut the cords, and I was
free.</p>
<p>"I took the hatchet that he gave me to cut some branches for a
fire, and went to work very meekly, with my head down.</p>
<p>"I dared not speak to Mary, for fear he might see me, for his
eyes were fixed on me every moment. I baked his corn cake in the
ashes, and gave it to him. By this time it was dark, but the
light from our fire shone far out into the woods.</p>
<p>"I noticed Red Feather did not watch me so closely, and his
eyes would now and then shut, for he was very tired.</p>
<p>"He leaned forward to light his pipe in the ashes, when
instantly, almost without thinking, I seized the hatchet, and
struck him with all my might.</p>
<p>"With a loud scream, I plunged into the woods toward home.
Turning an instant, I saw Mary spring up, totter, and fall. With
another sharp report came a twinge of pain in my side. Suddenly I
fell, and in the darkness of the woods, they passed on, leaving
me stunned and nearly dead.</p>
<p>"I will not tell you now, my dear Robbie, how I was cared for,
and who brought home little Mary and laid her to rest under the
elm, beside mother&mdash;but the bullet that struck me then, I
still carry in my side, and shall as long as I live.</p>
<p>"Many years have passed since that terrible day, but I can
never forget it. As long as the history of this country lasts,
Indian Spring will be remembered, and other boys will listen,
with eyes as wide open as yours, to the tale it has to tell."</p>

<h3>AN ADVENTURE WITH A SHARK.</h3>
<p>Our noble ship lay at anchor in the Bay of Tangiers, a town in
the north-west part of Africa.</p>
<p>The day had been very mild, with a gentle breeze sweeping to
the northward and westward. Toward the close of the day the
sea-breeze died away, and hot, sultry breathings came from the
great, sunburnt desert of Sahara.</p>
<p>Half an hour before sundown, the captain gave the cheering
order to call the hands to "go in swimming"; and, in less than
five minutes, the forms of our sailors were seen leaping from the
arms of the lower yards into the water.</p>
<p>One of the sails, with its corners fastened from the main
yard-arm and the swinging boom, had been lowered into the water,
and into this most of the swimmers made their way.</p>
<p>Among those who seemed to be enjoying the sport most heartily
were two boys, one of whom was the son of our old gunner; and, in
a laughing mood, they started out from the sail on a race.</p>
<p>There was a loud ringing shout of joy on their lips as they
put off; they darted through the water like fishes. The surface
of the sea was smooth as glass, though its bosom rose in long,
heavy swells that set in from the ocean.</p>
<p>One of the buoys which was attached to the anchor, to show
where it lay, was far away on the starboard quarter, where it
rose and fell with the lazy swell of the waves.</p>
<p>Towards this buoy the two lads made their way, the old
gunner's son taking the lead; but, when they were within about
sixty yards of the buoy, the other boy shot ahead and promised to
win the race.</p>
<p>The old gunner had watched the progress of his son with great
pride; and when he saw him drop behind, he leaped upon the
quarter-deck, and was just upon the point of urging him on by a
shout, when a cry was heard that struck him with instant
horror.</p>
<p>"A shark! a shark!" shouted the officer of the deck; and, at
the sound of those terrible words, the men who were in the water,
leaped and plunged toward the ship.</p>
<p>Three or four hundred yards away, the back of a monster shark
was seen cleaving the water. Its course was for the boys.</p>
<p>For a moment the gunner stood like one who had lost his
reason; then he shouted at the top of his voice for the boys to
turn; but they heard him not.</p>
<p>Stoutly the two swimmers strove, knowing nothing of the danger
from the shark. Their merry laughter still rang over the waters,
as they were both nearing the buoy.</p>
<p>O, what anxiety filled the heart of the gunner! A boat had put
off, but he knew it could not reach the boys in time to prevent
the shark from overtaking them.</p>
<p>Every moment he expected to see the monster sink from
sight,&mdash;then he knew all hope would be gone. At this moment
a cry was heard on board the ship, that reached every
heart,&mdash;the boys had discovered their enemy.</p>
<p>The cry startled the old gunner, and, quicker than thought, he
sprung from the quarter-deck. The guns were all loaded and
shotted, fore and aft, and none knew their temper better than
he.</p>
<p>With steady hand, made strong by sudden hope, the old gunner
pricked the cartridge of one of the quarter guns; then he took
from his pocket a percussion cap, fixed it on its place, and set
back the hammer of the gun-lock.</p>
<p>With great exertions, the old man turned the heavy gun to its
bearing, and then seizing the string of the lock, he stood back
and watched for the next swell that would bring the shark in
range. He had aimed the piece some distance ahead of his mark;
but yet a moment would settle his hopes and fears.</p>
<p>Every breath was hushed, and every heart in that old ship beat
painfully. The boat was yet some distance from the boys, while
the horrid sea-monster was fearfully near.</p>
<div class="figright"><img alt="old-gunner (54K)" src=
"images/073.jpg" height="500" width="357" /></div>
<p>Suddenly the silence was broken by the roar of the gun; and,
as the old man knew his shot was gone, he covered his face with
his hands, as if afraid to see the result. If he had failed, he
knew that his boy was lost.</p>
<p>For a moment after the report of the gun had died away upon
the air, there was an unbroken silence; but, as the thick smoke
arose from the surface of the water, there was, at first, a low
murmur breaking from the lips of the men,&mdash;that murmur grew
louder and stronger, till it swelled to a joyous, deafening
shout.</p>
<p>The old gunner sprung to his feet, and gazed off on the water,
and the first thing that met his sight was the huge body of the
shark floating on its back, the shot aimed by him having
instantly killed it.</p>
<p>In a few moments the boat reached the daring swimmers, and,
greatly frightened, they were brought on board. The old man
clasped his boy in his arms, and then, overcome by the powerful
excitement, he leaned upon a gun for support.</p>

<h3>A LEGEND OF THE NORTHLAND.</h3>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>Away, away in the Northland,</p>
<p class="i2">Where the hours of the day are few,</p>
<p>And the nights are so long in winter,</p>
<p class="i2">They can not sleep them through;</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>Where they harness the swift reindeer</p>
<p class="i2">To the sledges when it snows;</p>
<p>And the children look like bear's cubs,</p>
<p class="i2">In their funny, furry clothes:</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>They tell them a curious story&mdash;</p>
<p class="i2">I don't believe 'tis true;</p>
<p>And yet you may learn a lesson</p>
<p class="i2">If I tell the tale to you.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>Once, when the good Saint Peter</p>
<p class="i2">Lived in the world below,</p>
<p>And walked about it, preaching,</p>
<p class="i2">Just as he did, you know;</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>He came to the door of a cottage,</p>
<p class="i2">In traveling round the earth,</p>
<p>Where a little woman was making cakes,</p>
<p class="i2">In the ashes on the hearth.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>And being faint with fasting&mdash;</p>
<p class="i2">For the day was almost done&mdash;</p>
<p>He asked her, from her store of cakes,</p>
<p class="i2">To give him a single one.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>So she made a very little cake,</p>
<p class="i2">But as it baking lay,</p>
<p>She looked at it and thought it seemed</p>
<p class="i2">Too large to give away.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>Therefore she kneaded another,</p>
<p class="i2">And still a smaller one;</p>
<p>But it looked, when she turned it over,</p>
<p class="i2">As large as the first had done.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>Then she took a tiny scrap of dough,</p>
<p class="i2">And rolled and rolled it flat;</p>
<p>And baked it thin as a wafer&mdash;</p>
<p class="i2">But she couldn't part with that.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>For she said, "My cakes that seem so small</p>
<p class="i2">When I eat of them myself,</p>
<p>Are yet too large to give away."</p>
<p class="i2">So she put them on a shelf.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>Then good Saint Peter grew angry,</p>
<p class="i2">For he was hungry and faint;</p>
<p>And surely such, a woman</p>
<p class="i2">Was enough to provoke a saint.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>And he said, "You are far too selfish</p>
<p class="i2">To dwell in a human form,</p>
<p>To have both food and shelter,</p>
<p class="i2">And fire to keep you warm.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>"Now, you shall build as the birds do,</p>
<p class="i2">And shall get your scanty food</p>
<p>By boring, and boring, and boring,</p>
<p class="i2">All day in the hard dry wood."</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>Then up she went through the chimney.</p>
<p class="i2">Never speaking a word;</p>
<p>And out of the top flew a woodpecker,</p>
<p class="i2">For she was changed to a bird.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>She had a scarlet cap on her head,</p>
<p class="i2">And that was left the same,</p>
<p>But all the rest of her clothes were burned</p>
<p class="i2">Black as a coal in the flame.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>And every country school-boy</p>
<p class="i2">Has seen her in the wood;</p>
<p>Where she lives in the trees till this very day</p>
<p class="i2">Boring and boring for food.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>And this is the lesson she teaches:</p>
<p class="i2">Live not for yourselves alone,</p>
<p>Lest the needs you will not pity</p>
<p class="i2">Shall one day be your own.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>Give plenty of what is given to you,</p>
<p class="i2">Listen to pity's call;</p>
<p>Don't think the little you give is great,</p>
<p class="i2">And the much you get is small.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>Now, my little boy, remember that,</p>
<p class="i2">And try to be kind and good,</p>
<p>When you see the woodpecker's sooty dress,</p>
<p class="i2">And see her scarlet hood.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>You mayn't be changed to a bird, though you live</p>
<p class="i2">As selfishly as you can;</p>
<p>But you will be changed to a smaller thing&mdash;</p>
<p class="i2">A mean and selfish man.</p>

<h3>A FUNNY HORSESHOE.</h3>
<p>"What a funny horseshoe!" said Charlie, "It has no holes for
the nails!"</p>
<p>I looked up and saw that he had taken up a small "horseshoe
magnet."</p>
<p>"Why that isn't a horseshoe," I said. "It's a magnet."</p>
<p>"Magnet! What's that?"</p>
<p>Charlie turned it over in his hands, and pulled the bar a
little. The bar slipped so that it hung only by a corner.</p>
<p>"Never mind," I said, as he looked up with a scared
expression. "It isn't broken. Put the bar back."</p>
<p>Charlie put it back, and it sprung into place with a sharp
click.</p>
<p>"That's funny!" he cried again. "What made it jump so? And
what makes it stick? It doesn't feel sticky."</p>
<p>"We call it magnetism," I said. "Now, take hold of the bar,
and see if you can pull it straight off."</p>
<p>"I can't. It sticks fast."</p>
<p>"Pull harder."</p>
<p>Charlie braced himself for a strong pull. Suddenly the bar
came off, and he went tumbling backward.</p>
<p>"What did you say makes it hold so hard?" said he, getting
up.</p>
<p>"Magnetism," said I again.</p>
<p>"But what is magnetism?"</p>
<p>"I couldn't tell you if I tried; but I think you could learn a
great deal about it with that magnet. You will find a lot of
things in that box that may help you."</p>
<p>Saying this, I left him to pursue his studies as best he
could. When I came back, I found him more puzzled than when I
left him.</p>
<p>"That's the queerest thing I ever saw," he said. "Some things
just jump at it as though they were alive; some things it pulls;
and some things it doesn't pull a bit."</p>
<p>"That's a very long lesson you have learned," I said. "What
does it pull?"</p>
<p>"These," he said, pointing to a pile of things on one side of
the box. "And these things it doesn't pull."</p>
<p>"Let us see what you have in this pile," I said, looking at
the first little heap; "keys?"</p>
<p>"Trunk keys," said Charlie. "It doesn't pull door keys. I
tried ever so many."</p>
<p>"Try this key," said I, taking one from my pocket. "This is a
trunk key. See if the magnet pulls it."</p>
<p>"No-o," said Charlie, thoughtfully, "it doesn't; but it pulled
all the rest of the trunk keys I could find."</p>
<p>"Try this key to my office door."</p>
<p>Charlie tried it, and to his great amazement the key stuck
fast to the magnet.</p>
<p>"Surely," said I, "it pulls some door keys, and fails to pull
some trunk keys."</p>
<p>Charlie was more puzzled than ever. He looked at the keys,
thought a moment, then picked up my trunk key, and said: "This
key is brass; the rest are iron."</p>
<p>"That's so," I said.</p>
<p>"And all these door keys that the magnet didn't pull," he
continued, "are brass, too. Perhaps it can't pull brass
things."</p>
<p>"Suppose you try. But first see if there are any brass things
that the magnet pulled."</p>
<p>Charlie looked them over. Then we tried the casters of my
chair, and all the other brass things we could find, none of
which the magnet would pull.</p>
<p>"There's no use in trying any longer," said Charlie. "It won't
pull brass."</p>
<p>"Then, there's another matter settled," I said. "The magnet
does not pull brass. Is there any thing else it does not
pull?"</p>
<p>"Wood," said Charlie. "I tried lots of pieces."</p>
<p>"Any thing else?"</p>
<p>"Stones," said Charlie, eagerly.</p>
<p>"What are these?" I asked, holding up a couple of heavy stones
he had put among the things the magnet pulled.</p>
<p>"I guess I put those there by mistake," said Charlie, testing
with, the magnet a number of stones in the other pile.</p>
<p>"Try them," I said.</p>
<p>"O!" he said, as the magnet lifted them; "I forgot. It does
lift some stones."</p>
<p>"Well, what else have you in that pile of things the magnet
did not pull?"</p>
<p>"Glass, leather, lead, bone, cloth, tin, zinc, corn, and a lot
of things."</p>
<p>"Very well. Now let us see what the magnet does pull."</p>
<p>"Iron keys," said Charlie, "and nails."</p>
<p>"Here's a nail in this other pile."</p>
<p>"That's a brass nail. The magnet pulls only iron nails."</p>
<p>"What else have we in this pile?"</p>
<p>"Needles, hair-pins, screws, wire&mdash;iron wire," he added
quickly. "Brass wire doesn't stick, you know."</p>
<p>"How about this?" I asked, taking a small coil of copper wire
from my desk.</p>
<p>"I guess that won't stick," said Charlie. "Because that's
copper wire, and the magnet doesn't seem to pull any thing that
isn't iron."</p>
<p>Much to Charlie's satisfaction, the magnet did not pull the
copper wire. Then I took up two stones, one rusty red, the other
black, and said: "What about these?"</p>
<p>"I guess they must have iron in them too," said Charlie. "Have
they?"</p>
<p>"They have," I replied. "They are iron ores from which iron is
made. Why did you think there was iron in them?"</p>
<p>"Because they wouldn't have stuck to the magnet if there
wasn't."</p>
<p>"Quite true. So you have learned another very important fact.
Can you tell me what it is?"</p>
<p>"The magnet pulls iron," said Charlie.</p>
<p>"Good," said I; "and it is also true that the magnet does not
pull&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Things that are not iron," said Charlie.</p>
<p>"True again," I said. "So far as our experiments go, the
magnet pulls iron always, and never any thing else."</p>
<p>"But what makes it pull iron?"</p>
<p>"That I can not tell. We see it does pull, but just how the
pulling is done, or what makes it, no one has yet found out.</p>
<p>"For convenience we call the pulling power magnetism. You may
keep the magnet, and at some other time, I will tell you more
about it."</p>

<h3>THE GIRAFFE OR CAMELOPARD.</h3>
<p>There are few sights more pleasing than a herd of tall and
graceful giraffes.</p>
<p>With, their heads reaching a height of from twelve to eighteen
feet, they move about in small herds on the open plains of
Africa, eating the tender twigs and leaves of the mimosa and
other trees.</p>
<p>The legs of a large giraffe are about nine feet long, and its
neck nearly six feet; while its body measures only seven feet in
length and slopes rapidly from the neck to the tail.</p>
<p>The graceful appearance of the giraffe is increased by the
beauty of its skin, which is orange red in color and mottled with
dark spots.</p>
<p>Its long tail has at the end a tuft of thick hair which serves
the purpose of keeping off the flies and stinging insects, so
plentiful in the hot climate of Africa.</p>
<div class="figright"><img alt="giraffe (75K)" src=
"images/086.jpg" height="500" width="419" /></div>
<p>Its tongue is very wonderful. It is from thirteen to seventeen
inches in length, is slender and pointed, and is capable of being
moved in various ways. It is almost as useful to the giraffe as
the trunk is to the elephant.</p>
<p>The horns of the giraffe are very short and covered with skin.
At the ends there are tufts of short hair. The animal has divided
hoofs somewhat resembling those of the ox.</p>
<p>The head of the giraffe is small, and its eyes, large and mild
looking. These eyes are set in such a way that the animal can see
a great deal of what is behind it without turning its head.</p>
<p>In addition to its wonderful power of sight, the giraffe can
scent danger from a great distance; so there is no animal more
difficult of approach.</p>
<p>Strange to relate, the giraffe has no voice. In London, some
years ago, two giraffes were burned to death in their stables,
when the slightest sound would have given notice of their danger,
and saved their lives.</p>
<p>The giraffe is naturally both gentle and timid, and he will
always try to avoid danger by flight. It is when running that he
exposes his only ungraceful point.</p>
<p>He runs swiftly, but as he moves the fore and hind legs on
each side at the same time, it gives him a very displeasing and
awkward gait.</p>
<p>But though timid, he will, when overtaken, turn even upon the
lion or panther, and defend himself successfully by powerful
kicks with his strong legs.</p>
<p>The natives of Africa capture the giraffe in pitfalls, which
are deep holes covered over with branches of trees and dirt. When
captured, he can be tamed, and gives scarcely any trouble during
captivity.</p>
<p>Fifty years ago, but little was known about giraffes in Europe
or America. Now we can find them in menageries and the public
gardens of our large cities.</p>
<p>The giraffe thrives in captivity and seems to be well
satisfied with a diet of corn and hay. It is a source of great
satisfaction to those who admire this beautiful animal, that
there is no reason which prevents him from living in a climate so
different from that of his African home.</p>

<h3>THE TRADER'S TRICK.</h3>
<p>Out in the West, where many Indians live, there are white men
who go among them to trade for furs and skins of animals.</p>
<p>These furs and skins are collected and prepared by the
Indians, and serve the purpose of money when the traders visit
them to dispose of various kinds of goods.</p>
<p>In old times, before the white men came to this country, the
Indians had only bows and arrows, and spears with which to
hunt.</p>
<p>But the white men soon taught them to use guns, and to-day,
nearly all the tribes in America are well supplied with rifles or
shotguns.</p>
<p>They are very expert with these fire-arms, and as they use
them a great deal, must have a large and constant supply of
gunpowder.</p>
<p>A story is told of how, at one time, a tribe of Indians tried
to raise gunpowder by planting seed. This shows how little they
knew of civilized life and habits.</p>
<p>A trader went to a certain Indian nation to dispose of a stock
of goods. Among other things he had a quantity of gunpowder.</p>
<p>The Indians traded for his cloths, hats, axes, beads, and
other things, but would not take the powder, saying: "We do not
wish for the powder; we have plenty."</p>
<p>The trader did not like to carry all the powder back to his
camp; so thought he would play a trick on the Indians, and induce
them to buy it.</p>
<p>Going to an open piece of ground near the Indian camp, he dug
some little holes in the soft, rich soil; then mixing a quantity
of onion seed with his powder, he began to plant it.</p>
<p>The Indians were curious to know what he was doing, and stood
by greatly interested.</p>
<p>"What are you doing?" said one. "Planting gunpowder," replied
the trader.</p>
<p>"Why do you plant it?" inquired another.</p>
<p>"To raise a crop of powder. How could I raise it without
planting?" said the trader. "Do you not plant corn in the
ground?"</p>
<p>"And will gunpowder grow like corn?" exclaimed half a dozen at
once.</p>
<p>"Certainly it will," said the trader. "Did you not know it? As
you do not want my powder, I thought I would plant it, and raise
a crop which I could gather and sell to the Crows."</p>
<p>Now the Crows were another tribe of Indians, which was always
at war with this tribe. The idea of their enemies having a large
supply of powder increased the excitement, and one of the Indians
said:</p>
<p>"Well, well, if we can raise powder like corn, we will buy
your stock and plant it."</p>
<p>But some of the Indians thought best to wait, and see if the
seed would grow. So the trader agreed to wait a few days.</p>
<p>In about a week the tiny sprouts of the onion seed began to
appear above the ground.</p>
<p>The trader calling the Indians to the spot, said: "You see now
for yourselves. The powder already begins to grow, just as I told
you it would."</p>
<p>The fact that some small plants appeared where the trader had
put the gunpowder, was enough to convince the Indians.</p>
<p>Every one of them became anxious to raise a crop of
gunpowder.</p>
<p>The trader sold them his stock, in which there was a large
mixture of onion seeds, at a very high price, and then left.</p>
<p>From this time, the Indians gave no attention to their corn
crop. If they could raise gunpowder, they would be happy.</p>
<p>They took great care of the little plants as they came up out
of the ground, and watched every day for the appearance of the
gunpowder blossoms.</p>
<p>They planned a buffalo hunt which was to take place after the
powder harvest.</p>
<p>After a while the onions bore a plentiful crop of seeds, and
the Indians began to gather and thresh it.</p>
<p>They believed that threshing the onion seeds would produce the
powder. But threshing failed to bring it. Then they discovered
that they had been cheated.</p>
<p>Of course the dishonest trader avoided these Indians, and did
not make them a second visit.</p>
<p>After some time, however, he sent his partner to them for the
purpose of trading goods for furs and skins.</p>
<p>By chance they found out that this man was the partner of the
one who had cheated them.</p>
<p>They said nothing to him about the matter; but when he had
opened his goods and was ready to trade, they coolly helped
themselves to all he had, and walked off.</p>
<p>The trader did not understand this. He became furiously angry,
and went to make his complaint to the chief of the nation.</p>
<p>"I am an honest man," said he to the chief. "I came here to
trade honestly. But your people are thieves; they have stolen all
my goods."</p>
<p>The old chief looked at him some time in silence, and then
said: "My children are all honest. They have not stolen your
goods. They will pay you as soon as they gather their gunpowder
harvest."</p>
<p>The man had heard of the trick played upon the Indians; but
did not know before this, that his partner was the one who had
cheated them. He could not say a word. He departed at once.
Arriving at his home, he said to his partner:</p>
<p>"We must separate. I have learned a lesson. I can not remain
in business with a dishonest man. You cheated the Indians for a
little gain. You have lost it, and I advise you, henceforth, to
deal honestly with all men."</p>

<h3>ALI, THE BOY CAMEL-DRIVER&mdash;PART I.</h3>
<p>Hassan was a camel-driver who dwelt at Gaza. It was his
business to go with caravans, backwards and forwards, across the
desert to Suez, to take care of the camels. He had a wife and one
young son, called Ali.</p>
<p>Hassan had been, absent for many weeks, when his wife received
from him a message, brought by another camel-driver, who had
returned with a caravan from Suez.</p>
<p>It said: "Send the boy with the camel to Suez with the next
caravan. I have some merchandise to bring home, and I will stop
at Suez till he comes."</p>
<p>Ali's mother was pained at the thought of sending her young
son away to such a distance for the first time; but she said to
herself that Ali was now quite old enough to be helping his
father, and she at once set about doing what was required for his
journey.</p>
<p>Ali got out the trappings for the camel, and looked to the
water-bottles to see that they did not leak. His mother did all
that was needed to make him quite ready to join the next caravan
that started.</p>
<p>Ali was delighted to think that he was to go to his father,
and that at last the day was come when, he too was to be a
camel-driver, and to take a journey with the dear old camel which
he was so fond of.</p>
<p>He had long wanted to ride on its back across the desert, and
to lie down by its side to rest at night. He had no fear.</p>
<p>The camel, of which Ali was so fond, had been bought by his
father with the savings of many a year's hard work, and formed
the sole riches of the family.</p>
<p>Hassan was looked upon as quite a rich man by the other
camel-drivers, and Ali, besides having a great love for the
animal, was proud of his father being a camel owner.</p>
<p>Though it was a great creature by the side of the young boy,
it would obey the voice of Ali, and come and go at his bidding,
and lie down and rise up just as he wished. Hassan called his
camel by an Arabian word, which meant "Meek-eye."</p>
<p>At last, there was a caravan about to start for Suez which Ali
could join. The party met near the gates of the city, where there
were some wells, at which the water-bottles could be filled.
Ali's mother attended, and bid her son a loving farewell.</p>
<p>The caravan started. The camels which were to lead the way,
had around their necks jingling bells, which the others hearing,
followed without other guidance.</p>
<p>Ali looked about and saw his mother standing near the city
gate. He took his cap off and waved it above his head, and his
mother took off the linen cloth which she wore over her head, and
waved it.</p>
<p>Tramp, tramp, tramp went the camels, their soft spongy feet
making a noise as they trod the ground. The camel-drivers
laughed, and talked to each other.</p>
<p>Ali was the only boy in the caravan, and no one seemed to
notice him. He had a stout heart, and tried not to care.</p>
<p>He could talk to Meek-eye, and this he did, patting the
creature's back, and telling him they would soon see his
father.</p>
<p>The sun rose higher and higher, and the day grew hotter and
hotter. The morning breeze died away, and the noon was close and
sultry.</p>
<p>The sand glowed like fire. There was nothing to be seen but
sand and sky. At mid-day a halt was made at one of the places
well known to the drivers, where shade and water could be
had.</p>
<p>The water-bottles were not to be touched that day, for at this
place a little stream, which gushed from a rock, supplied enough
for the men, while the camels needed no water for many days.</p>
<p>After resting a short time, the kneeling camels were made to
rise, the riders first placing themselves on their backs, and the
caravan then moved on.</p>
<p>At night the party encamped for rest, the camels lying down,
while fires were lighted and food was prepared.</p>
<p>Several days were thus passed, and Ali found that he liked
this kind of life as well as he thought he should.</p>
<p>No Arabs were met with, nor even seen; but a danger of the
desert, worse than a party of Arabs, came upon them.</p>
<p>There arose one day at noon, one of those fearful burning
winds which do such mischief to the traveler and his camel. The
loose sand was raised like a cloud. It filled the nostrils and
blinded the eyes.</p>
<p>The only thing to be done, was for the men to get off the
backs of the camels, and lie down with their faces to the
earth.</p>
<p>After the storm had passed, they arose to continue their
journey. But the sand had been so blown as to cover the beaten
track, and thus all trace of the road was lost.</p>
<p>The camel-drivers who led the way stood still, and said that
they did not know which way to turn.</p>
<p>No distant rock or palm-tree was to be seen, and no one could
say which was the south, towards which their faces ought to be
turned.</p>
<p>They wandered on, now turning to the right, and now to the
left; and sometimes, when they had gone some distance in one
direction, retracing their steps and trying another.</p>
<p>The caravan made a halt, and it was now decided to journey
towards the setting sun, in hopes of finding once more the right
track.</p>
<p>Night came on, however, and they had not found it, nor had
they reached any place where they could fill their water-bottles,
which were empty.</p>
<p>Once or twice, some one of the party fancied that he saw in
the distance the top of a palm-tree; but no, it turned out to be
but a little cloud upon the horizon.</p>
<p>They had not yet found the old track; neither had they
supplied themselves with water to cool their parched lips.</p>

<h3>ALI, THE BOY CAMEL-DRIVER.&mdash;PART II.</h3>
<p>Poor Ali suffered like the rest from terrible thirst. He drank
the last drop of water from his water-bottle, and thought of the
morrow with fear.</p>
<p>He was so tired when night came, he was glad to lie down by
the side of Meek-eye and go to sleep. Ali slept, but before
morning, was awakened by the sound of voices.</p>
<p>He listened, and heard the chief driver tell one of the
merchants that, if they did not find water very soon, the next
day a camel must be killed, in order to get the water contained
in its stomach.</p>
<p>This is often done in cases of great need in the desert, the
stomach of the camel being so formed as to hold a great quantity
of water.</p>
<p>Ali was not surprised to hear such a thing spoken of; but what
was his distress and alarm, when he heard the merchant propose
that it should be "the boy's camel" that should be killed!</p>
<p>The merchant said the other camels were of too good a kind,
and of too much value; while, as to this young boy, what business
had he to have a camel of his own?</p>
<p>It would be better far, they said, for him to lose his camel
than for him to die, like the rest, of thirst. And so it was
decided that Meek-eye should be killed, unless water were found
the next morning.</p>
<p>Ali slept no more. His heart was full of grief; but his grief
was mixed with courage and resolution. He said to himself that
Meek-eye should not die.</p>
<p>His father had trusted him to bring the camel, and what would
he say if he should arrive at Suez without it? He would try to
find his way alone, and leave the caravan as soon as
possible.</p>
<p>That night when all was quiet, and the merchant and
camel-driver had gone to sleep, Ali arose, and gently patting the
neck of Meek-eye, awoke him.</p>
<p>He placed his empty bag and water-bottles on his back, and
seating himself on him, made signs for the creature to rise, and
then suddenly started off.</p>
<p>Tramp, tramp, tramp, went Meek-eye over the soft sand. The
night was cool and refreshing, and Ali felt stronger and braver
with every tramp. The stars were shining brightly, and they were
his only guides.</p>
<p>He knew the star which was always in the north, and the one
which was in the west after the sun had gone down. He must keep
that star to the right, and he would be sure to be going towards
the south.</p>
<p>He journeyed on till day began to dawn. The sun came up on the
edge of the desert, and rose higher and higher. Ali felt faint,
weary, and thirsty, and could scarcely hold himself on to
Meek-eye. When he thought of his father and mother, he took
courage again, and bore up bravely.</p>
<p>The sun was now at its height. Ali fancied he saw a palm-tree
in the distance. It seemed as if Meek-eye saw it also, for he
raised his head and quickened his step.</p>
<p>It was not long before Ali found himself at one of those
pleasant green islands which are found throughout the desert, and
are called oases.</p>
<p>He threw himself from the camel's back, and hunted out the
pool of water that he knew he should find in the midst of the
reeds and long grass which grew there.</p>
<p>He dipped in his water-bottle and drank, while Meek-eye, lying
down, stretched out his long neck, and greedily sucked up great
draughts of the cool water.</p>
<p>How sweet was the sleep which crept over them as they lay down
in the shade of the great palm-tree, now that they had quenched
their thirst!</p>
<p>Refreshed and rested, Ali was able to satisfy his hunger on
some ripe dates from the palm-tree, while Meek-eye began to feed
upon the grass and leaves around.</p>
<p>Ali noticed, while eating his dates, that other travelers had
been there recently: as the grass at the side of the pool was
trampled down. This greatly cheered him. He quickly followed in
their track, still going in a southerly direction.</p>
<p>He kept the setting sun to his right, and when it had gone
down, he noticed the bright star that had guided him before.</p>
<p>He traveled on, tired and faint with hunger for many a mile,
till at last he saw, a long way off, the fires of a caravan which
had halted for the night.</p>
<p>Ali soon came up to them. He got down, from Meek-eye, and
leading him by the bridle, came towards a group of camel-drivers,
who were sitting in a circle.</p>
<p>He told them his story, and asked permission to join the
party, and begged a little rice, for which he was ready to pay
with the piece of money that his mother had given him when he
left home.</p>
<p>Ali was kindly received by them, and allowed to partake of
their supper. The men admired the courage with which he had saved
his favorite camel. After supper Ali soon closed his weary eyes,
and slept soundly by the side of Meek-eye.</p>
<p>In the midst of a pleasant dream, Ali was suddenly aroused by
the sound of tinkling bells, and on waking up he saw that another
caravan had arrived, which had come from the south.</p>
<p>The merchants sat down to wait until their supper was brought
to them, and a party of camel-drivers drew round the fire near
which Ali had been sleeping. They raked up its ashes, put on
fresh fuel, and then prepared to boil their rice.</p>
<p>What voice was that which roused Ali just as he was falling
asleep again? He listened, he started to his feet, he looked
about him, and waited for a flash of flame from the fire to fall
on the faces of the camel-drivers who stood around it.</p>
<p>It came flickering up at first, and then all at once blazing
out, flashed upon the camel-driver who stood stooping over it,
and lighted up the face of Ali's father!</p>
<p>The father had waited at Suez many days, wondering why Ali did
not come; and then, thinking there had been some mistake,
determined to return home with the caravan, which was starting
for Gaza.</p>
<p>We need hardly describe the joy of both father and son at thus
meeting, nor the pleasure with which the father listened to the
history of Ali the fears and dangers to which his young son had
been exposed. He was glad, too, that their precious Meek-eye had
been saved.</p>
<p>There was no one in the whole caravan so happy as Hassan,
when, the next morning, he continued, his journey to Gaza in
company with Meek-eye and his beloved son Ali.</p>

<h3>A QUEER PEOPLE.</h3>
<p>One evening, as Captain Perry was sitting by the fireside at
his home in Liverpool, his children asked him to tell them a
story.</p>
<div class="figright"><img alt="fireside story (33K)" src=
"images/110.jpg" height="500" width="421" /></div>
<p>"What shall it be about?" said the captain.</p>
<p>"O," said Harry, "tell us about other countries, and the
curious people you have seen in them."</p>
<p>"Yes, yes!" exclaimed Mary. "We were much interested, while
you were away the last time, in reading 'Gulliver's Travels' and
'Sindbad the Sailor.'"</p>
<p>"You have seen as wonderful things as they did, haven't you,
father?" said Harry.</p>
<p>"No, my dears," said the captain. "I never met such wonderful
people as they tell about, I assure you; nor have I seen the
'Black Loadstone Mountain' or the 'Valley of Diamonds.'"</p>
<p>"But," said Mary, "you have seen a great many people, and
their different manners and ways of living."</p>
<p>"Yes," said the captain, "and if it will interest you, I will
tell you some of the curious things that I have observed."</p>
<p>"Pray, do so!" cried Harry, as both the children drew close to
him.</p>
<p>"Well, then," began the captain, "I was once in a country where it was very
cold, and the poor people could scarcely keep themselves from
starving.</p>
<p>"They were clothed partly in the skins of beasts, made smooth
and soft by some particular art; but chiefly in garments made
from the outer covering of an animal cruelly stripped off its
back while alive.</p>
<p>"They lived in houses partly sunk below the ground. These
houses were mostly built of stones or of earth hardened by
fire.</p>
<p>"The walls of the houses had holes to let in light; but to
prevent the cold air and rain from coming in, they were covered
with a sort of transparent stone, made of melted sand.</p>
<p>"As wood was rather scarce, they used for fuel a certain kind
of stone which they dug out of the earth, and which, when put
among burning wood, catches fire and makes a bright flame."</p>
<p>"Dear me!" said Harry. "What a wonderful stone! Why didn't you
bring a piece home with you, father?"</p>
<p>"I have a piece, which I will show you some time," replied the
captain. "But to go on with my story.</p>
<p>"What these people eat is remarkable, too. Some of the poor
people eat fish which had been hung up and smoked until quite dry
and hard, and along with it they eat the roots of plants, or
coarse, black cake made of powdered seeds.</p>
<p>"The rich people have a whiter kind of cake upon which they
spread a greasy matter that is obtained from a large animal. They
eat also the flesh of many birds and beasts when they can get it,
and the leaves and other parts of a variety of
vegetables&mdash;some raw and others cooked.</p>
<p>"For drink they use the water in which certain dry leaves have
been steeped. These leaves, I was told, came from a country a
great distance away.</p>
<p>"I was glad to leave this country because it was so very cold;
but about six months after, I was obliged to go there again. What
was my surprise to find that great changes had taken place!</p>
<p>"The climate was mild and warm, and the country was full of
beauty and verdure. The trees and shrubs bore a great variety of
fruits, which, with other vegetable products, were used largely
as food.</p>
<p>"The people were gentle and civilized. Their dress was varied.
Many wore cloth woven from a sort of wool grown in pods on
bushes.</p>
<p>"Another singular material was a fine, glossy stuff used
chiefly by the rich people. I was told that it was made out of
the webs of caterpillars, which to me seemed quite wonderful, as
it must have taken a great number of caterpillars to produce the
large quantity of the stuff that I saw.</p>
<p>"These people have queer ideas about their dress. The women
wear strangely figured garments, and adorn their heads, like some
Indian nations, with feathers and other fanciful
head-dresses.</p>
<p>"One thing surprised me very much. They bring up in their
houses an animal of the tiger species, having the same kind of
teeth and claws as the tiger.</p>
<p>"In spite of the natural fierceness of this little beast, it is
played with and caressed by the most timid and delicate of their
women and children."</p>
<p>"I am sure I would not play with it," said Harry.</p>
<p>"You might get an ugly scratch, if you did," said the
captain.</p>
<p>"Aha!" cried Mary; "I've found you out: you have been telling
us of our country and what is done at home all this while!"</p>
<p>"But we don't burn stones, or eat grease and powdered seeds,
or wear skins and caterpillars' webs, or play with tigers," said
Harry.</p>
<p>"No?" said the captain. "Pray, what is coal but a kind of
stone; and is not butter, grease; and wheat, seeds; and leather,
skins; and silk, the web of a kind of caterpillar; and may we not
as well call a cat an animal of the tiger kind, as a tiger an
animal of the cat kind?</p>
<p>"So, if you will remember what I have been describing, you
will find that all the other wonderful things that I have told
you of, are well known among ourselves.</p>
<p>"I have told you the story to show that a foreigner might
easily represent every thing among us as equally strange and
wonderful, as we could with respect to his country."</p>

<div class="poem">

<p>Little Miss Brier came out of the ground,</p>

<h3>WATER.</h3>
<p>It is difficult to realize that nearly three-fourths of the
surface of the earth is water; yet it is a fact.</p>
<p>Think of the immense space covered by oceans, seas, lakes, and
rivers, and how useful all this water is to mankind.</p>
<p>Sailing ships and steam-ships traverse the oceans and lakes.
Steam-boats ply along the rivers, carrying people and merchandise
to and fro, going sometimes as far as three thousand miles from
their starting point.</p>
<p>It is by water that men float their rafts of logs or lumber to
distant places. Water turns the great wheels of many of our
mills, and thus harnessed to mighty machines, does more work than
thousands of men and horses.</p>
<p>These machines produce paper, cloth, flour, lumber, and many
other useful articles.</p>
<p>When water is heated and turned into steam, it moves powerful
engines. These engines propel our great steam-ships and
steam-boats and drive machines of all kinds in mills and
factories.</p>
<p>Many of you have seen water, clear and cool, trickling from
the rocks in the side of a hill. This water first forms a
spring.</p>
<p>From this spring, the water escapes in a tiny stream, called a
rivulet or creek, and flows along until it enters a river. Many
springs make many rivulets; many rivulets make large rivers.</p>
<p>Rivers sometimes receive such great quantities of water that
they overflow their banks, and destroy much valuable property.
This is called a freshet or a flood.</p>
<p>Many people who live near some of our rivers have lost their
houses, furniture, and cattle, which were all swept away by these
floods.</p>
<p>In the winter of 1883, the Ohio River received so much water
from the thousands of rivulets flowing into it, that it
overflowed its banks.</p>
<p>The result of this overflow was one of the greatest floods
ever known, and many, no doubt, who read this, were there to see
its terrible effects.</p>
<p>But where does all this water come from? you may ask.</p>
<p>Let me see if I can explain it to you. The water in all these
rivers, lakes, and oceans is constantly rising into the air in
what is called moisture or vapor. We can not see this moisture,
neither can we see the air.</p>
<p>If the air is cold, moisture does not rise rapidly; but, as
the air becomes heated, it takes up more moisture, so that the
more heat there is in the air, the more moisture rises.</p>
<p>Heated air is light, and rises higher and higher from the
ground, taking the moisture with it, until it reaches a point
where it begins to cool.</p>
<p>Then as the air cools, the moisture forms into clouds, and
these clouds are, in a certain sense, floating water.</p>
<p>Floating water! How can water float! do you ask?</p>
<p>Well, I will tell you. Cold air is heavier than heated air,
and until the clouds become so full of moisture as to return some
of it to the earth, in the shape of rain, they float because they
are lighter than the air underneath them.</p>
<p>The winds, by the flapping of their mighty wings, drive the
clouds over the land to the hills and the mountains and the
thirsty fields; and there they pour their blessings on the farms,
pastures, orchards, and the dusty roads and way-side grass,
bringing greenness and gladness every-where.</p>
<p>Without water nothing would grow; every thing would dry up and
wither.</p>
<p>All animals drink water, for it forms a part of their blood
and thus helps to keep them alive. All trees and plants drink it
by drawing it through their roots or leaves, for it helps to form
their sap.</p>
<p>Sometimes on a summer morning you will see drops of clear
sparkling water on flowers and grass.</p>
<p>To look at them you would think it had rained during the
night; but, noticing that the ground is dry, you know that no
rain has fallen.</p>
<p>What then are these glittering drops of water? Where do they
come from?</p>
<p>I will tell you.These drops are called dew. As night comes on,
the grass and the leaves of flowers and plants become cool.</p>
<p>When the warm air touches them, it becomes chilled, and as the
air can not then carry so much moisture as before, it leaves some
of its moisture on the flowers and grass.</p>
<p>A moisture like dew sometimes collects in the house. Did you
ever observe it in drops on the outside of a pitcher of cold
water? Some people suppose that the water comes through the
pitcher, but it does not.</p>
<p>The water being cold makes the pitcher cold, and as the warm
air of the room strikes it, a moisture like dew is left on the
pitcher, in the same manner as dew is left on grass, leaves, and
flowers.</p>
<p>In cold weather, when the dew gathers on plants and flowers,
it sometimes freezes and forms frost, and when the clouds throw
off their moisture in rain drops, the rain becomes sleet, hail,
or snow.</p>
<p>So you see that dew, rain, frost, sleet, snow, and hail are
only different forms of water.</p>

<h3>THE HIDDEN TREASURE.&mdash;PART I.</h3>
<p>On a pleasant street in the old town of Fairfield, stands a
neat, little cottage. This was formerly the home of Mrs. Reed, an
old lady respected by her neighbors and loved by all the young
people of the place.</p>
<p>There was about Mrs. Reed a kindly manner which pleased all
who knew her. Although very poor, she took much interest in her
young friends and tried to make them happy.</p>
<p>Mrs. Reed had not always been poor. Her husband when alive was
supposed to be rich; but after his death, it was found that
nothing was left to his widow but two small cottages.</p>
<p>In one of these cottages, Mrs. Reed lived; the other, she
rented. But the rent received was no more than enough to enable
her to live with moderate comfort. She had little or nothing left
with which to do for others.</p>
<p>One cold winter morning, two persons were talking together in
the cozy sitting-room of the cottage. One was Mrs. Reed, and the
other, Alice Brown, a poor orphan girl, who lived with some
distant relatives in Fairfield.</p>
<p>"You are very kind to come to see me so often, Alice," said
Mrs. Reed. "I wonder why you do; because there is nothing
attractive here."</p>
<p>"Why, Mrs. Reed!" replied Alice; "how can you talk so? are you
not here? do I not always receive a kind word and a welcome smile
from you?"</p>
<p>"Well, you know I love you, Alice, and am always delighted to
have you come," said Mrs. Reed; "I am sure that were it in my
power to do so, I would have you here all the time.</p>
<p>"I would like to give you books, have you attend school, and
do every thing to make you happy. But alas! Alice, you know I am
too poor to do what I wish, and at times it makes me feel very
sad."</p>
<p>"O, indeed you are too good, Mrs. Reed! My greatest pleasure
is to come and see you, and I hope you will always love me.</p>
<p>"I wish I could stay here all day; but you know that the day
after to-morrow will be Christmas, and I must hurry home now, as
auntie wants me to help her prepare for it. So good-by."</p>
<p>"But, Alice, you will come to see me Christmas morning, will
you not?" asked Mrs. Reed.</p>
<p>"Yes," replied Alice, "for a little while." And with a kiss
and another good-by, she left Mrs. Reed alone.</p>
<p>"What a dear good girl she is," said Mrs. Reed to herself, as
she watched Alice tripping down the street toward her home.</p>
<p>"She was so good to me last summer when I was ill! and here is
Christmas and I have no money with which to buy her a
present.</p>
<p>"O dear, dear! why was I left so poor! I am sure my husband
had some money; what could he have done with it!"</p>
<p>Mrs. Reed sat down in her rocking-chair and for a full half
hour looked thoughtfully into the fire. Starting up suddenly, she
again exclaimed to herself:</p>
<p>"I do really believe that if I go up into the garret, I can
find, something for a Christmas present, that will please
Alice.</p>
<p>"I remember a curious old box that Mr. Reed had, that was sent
to him from India. If I can find some bits of ribbon, and silk, I
will line it and make it into a nice little work-box for
Alice."</p>
<p>Then Mrs. Reed climbed up the narrow stairway into the garret,
and, after searching some time among the rubbish that lay around
in all the nooks and corners, discovered the box.</p>
<p>Taking it down-stairs and finding some pieces of silk, she
spent the rest of the day in making it into a work-box.</p>
<p>She made a pretty needle-book, a tiny pincushion, and an emery
bag like a big strawberry. Then from her own scanty stock she
added needles, pins, thread, and her only pair of small scissors,
scoured to the last extreme of brightness.</p>
<p>One thing only she had to buy&mdash;a thimble; and that she
bought for a penny. The thimble was of brass and so bright that
it was quite as handsome as gold.</p>
<p>When full, the little box was very pretty. In the bottom lay a
quilted lining, which had always been there, and upon which she
had placed the fittings.</p>

<h3>THE HIDDEN TREASURE.&mdash;PART II.</h3>
<p>Christmas morning came, and soon Alice Brown entered Mrs.
Reed's cottage and received a warm welcome.</p>
<p>"Merry Christmas! Mrs. Reed," said Alice.</p>
<p>"Thank you, my dear," replied Mrs. Reed; "it will indeed be a
'Merry Christmas' if you can remain with me this forenoon."</p>
<p>"Well, I can stay till dinner-time," said Alice. "See what a
pretty present cousin John sent me!" and Alice held up a new
pocket-book.</p>
<p>"That is very nice, Alice," said Mrs. Reed; "now if you had
some one to fill it with money, it would be better still."</p>
<p>"Yes, indeed," cried Alice, laughingly; "but as I was not so
fortunate as to receive any money, and have none of my own to put
in it, the pocket-book is not likely to be worn out for a long
time."</p>
<p>"Well, well, Alice," replied Mrs. Reed, "it is always handy to
have things in the house; for some time they may be needed.</p>
<p>"Excuse me a moment, Alice," continued Mrs. Reed; "sit down
here by the fire and warm yourself."</p>
<p>Alice took a seat by the fire and warmed her fingers; for,
although it was a bright sunshiny day, it was very cold.</p>
<p>Mrs. Reed stepped into the adjoining room, and with a light
heart and an expression on her face that no one had seen for many
a day, took up the little work-box she had prepared for
Alice.</p>
<p>Returning again to the sitting-room with the box in her hand,
she approached Alice and said;</p>
<p>"Here, my dear, is a little Christmas present I have for you.
I sincerely wish it were something better. It will be useful, I
know, and I hope it will please you."</p>
<p>"O how beautiful!" exclaimed Alice, as she caught sight of the
curious carvings on the outside of the box. "And a work-box,
too!" she continued, as she took it in her hands and lifted the
cover; "is it really for me?"</p>
<p>"For no one else, I assure you," replied Mrs. Reed, as her
face lighted up with joy, at seeing Alice so happy.</p>
<p>"O how can I ever thank you enough!" exclaimed Alice, as she
threw her arms around Mrs. Reed's neck and kissed her again and
again.</p>
<p>Then taking a seat by Mrs. Reed, Alice began to examine the
contents of the new work-box, lifting out the articles one by
one, and placing them in her lap.</p>
<p>She then admired the beautiful lining which. Mrs. Reed had put
in the box, asking her where she got such pretty pieces of
silk.</p>
<p>"That piece of silk at the top, Alice, is a bit of my
wedding-dress; and that on the sides, is a part of my
wedding-sash. Those remind me of happy days, Alice.</p>
<p>"I had plenty then: a good husband, a happy home, and never
thought that I should come to poverty."</p>
<p>"What is this from?" asked Alice, touching the silk lining at
the bottom of the box.</p>
<p>"O that was always in the box, Alice. It was there when my
husband received it, and must be a piece of India silk.</p>
<p>"Is any thing the matter with it?" continued Mrs. Reed, as she
noticed Alice picking at one corner of it.</p>
<p>"O nothing is the matter," replied Alice; "it only seemed to
me to be a little loose."</p>
<p>"Let me look," said Mrs. Reed. "I don't think it can be loose,
or I should have seen it when I was lining the box."</p>
<p>"It is actually quite loose," said Alice, as she examined it
further, and picked up one corner with, a pin; "and here is a
little piece of paper underneath it."</p>
<p>"That is remarkable," said Mrs. Reed, as she put on her
spectacles and drew up her chair a little closer to Alice.</p>
<p>"And there is some writing on it too," said Alice, as she drew
it from its hiding-place and handed it to Mrs. Reed.</p>
<p>"Why, it's my husband's writing!" exclaimed Mrs. Reed, as she
closely examined the faded letters. "What can it mean? I never
saw it before. Read it, Alice; your eyes are younger than
mine."</p>
<p>Alice read: "'Look and ye shall find,' and underneath this,"
continued Alice, "is a picture of a mantel-piece, and underneath
that, it reads: 'A word to the wise is sufficient.'"</p>
<p>Mrs. Reed again took the paper. Her hand trembled and her face
became a little pale.</p>
<p>"Alice," said she, "this is a picture of the old tile
mantel-piece in the other room. There is some mystery about this.
What can it mean?"</p>
<p>"Yes," said Alice, "the tiles in that mantel have quotations
on them."</p>
<p>In an instant, Alice was on her feet and sprung into the other
room, leaving Mrs. Reed in a state of wonderment.</p>
<p>Hastily examining the tiles in the mantel, Alice cried out: "O
Mrs. Reed, do come! here is a tile with exactly the same words on
it!"</p>
<p>Mrs. Reed hurried into the room, and had scarcely passed the
threshold, when the tile fell to the hearth and broke into a
dozen pieces.</p>

<p>"O what have I done! what have I done!" cried Alice. "O Mrs.
Reed, I'm so sorry&mdash;I have broken the tile!"</p>
<p>"How did it happen, Alice? Was it loose?"</p>
<p>"Why yes," replied Alice; "I put my hand on it, and thought it
appeared to move a little. Having my scissors with, me, I,
through curiosity, ran the points in between that tile and the
next one."</p>
<p>"Never mind, child," said Mrs. Reed kindly, seeing that Alice
was feeling sad over the mishap; "perhaps the tile can be
mended&mdash;let us see."</p>
<p>As they both stooped down to pick up the pieces, Alice noticed
that there was a hollow space back of where the tile had been,
and that it contained something of a dingy white color.</p>
<p>"O Mrs. Reed!" cried she; "there is something in there! See,
it looks like a bag tied up! May I take it out?"</p>
<p>Mrs. Reed turned deadly pale. "Yes," she replied, scarcely
knowing what she expected or dared hope.</p>
<div class="figright"><img alt="Alice and Mrs. Reed. (69K)" src="images/135.jpg"
height="500" width="430" /></div>
<p>Alice thrust her hand into the hole to pull the hag out, but
as it was very old, it fell apart, and O wonder of wonders! as
many as a hundred pieces of gold coin fell with a jingle on the
hearth and rolled every way.</p>
<p>"My husband's money!" exclaimed Mrs. Reed, as she leaned on
Alice to keep from falling.</p>
<p>Alice was nearly wild and talked like a crazy person.</p>
<p>"O goody, goody!" she cried, clapping her hands and jumping up
and down. "Now you can have everything you want! you won't be
poor any longer!"</p>
<p>But Mrs. Reed was too much overcome to hear what Alice
said.</p>
<p>She could scarcely realize the good fortune that had so
suddenly befallen her.</p>
<p>Presently, however, with the tenderness of a mother, she
placed her arms around Alice and said: "O you precious child! but
for you, I should never have known this!"</p>
<p>"And if you had not given me the work-box," said Alice,
"perhaps no one would ever have found it out.</p>
<p>"But," continued she, excitedly, "let us see if there is any
thing more in there."</p>
<p>Again reaching into the hole in the mantel-piece, she sprung
back with a look of amazement that frightened Mrs. Reed.</p>
<p>"Why, Alice, what is the matter?" inquired the old lady.</p>
<p>"Matter!" exclaimed Alice. "Why, dear me! Mrs. Reed, there are
lots and lots of bags in there yet!"</p>
<p>"Is it possible!" said Mrs. Reed hoarsely. Then reaching her
hand into the hole, she drew out bag after bag, handling them
very carefully, so that they would not fall to pieces as the
first one had done.</p>
<p>In the meantime Alice had pushed a table up near the
fire-place. The bags were emptied upon it, until the glittering
gold made a heap that struck Mrs. Reed and Alice with greater
amazement than ever.</p>
<p>"Alice," said Mrs. Reed, "this is a blessing from Heaven that
I do not deserve. I can not tell you how thankful I am for it. My
happiness now will be in doing for others."</p>
<p>Alice said nothing; her heart was too full. A look of sadness
came over her face.</p>
<p>She was wondering whether Mrs. Reed would continue to love
her, and thinking, with a mingled feeling of fear and dread, that
now her friend was rich, perhaps she, the poor orphan girl, might
not be so welcome at the cottage as before.</p>
<p>Mrs. Reed seemed to understand somewhat the nature of Alice's
thoughts. "Cheer up, Alice," said she; "this is not a time to be
sad! Come, help me put away this gold.</p>
<p>"By the way, Alice, now is the time to use your pocket-book;
you know I told you it was handy to have things in the house,
they might be needed," she continued, smilingly.</p>
<p>"Why, certainly, Mrs. Reed; do you want to borrow my
pocket-book? here it is."</p>
<p>"Yes, my dear," replied Mrs. Reed, "I shall want a new one
myself, and I want to see yours. I wonder how many pieces of gold
it will hold."</p>
<p>Then Mrs. Reed crammed the pocket-book full of gold
pieces.</p>
<p>"There!" said she, handing it to Alice; "that is the Christmas
present I wanted to give you this morning, but did not have
it."</p>
<p>"What! this for me! O no, no! I do not deserve it!" cried
Alice.</p>
<p>"But you must take it, Alice, and listen; for I have something
to tell you. I want you to be my daughter now. I will have
abundant means to make both of us comfortable and happy."</p>
<p>"O Mrs. Reed," said Alice, bursting into tears; "I would love
to be your daughter, nothing could make me happier."</p>
<p>In a very short time every thing was changed in the little
cottage. Mrs. Reed had legally adopted Alice as her daughter and
was sending her to school.</p>
<p>Fresh paint, inside and out, and many new comforts, made the
old house charming and bright. But nothing could change the happy
relations between the two friends, and a more contented and
cheerful household could not be found anywhere.</p>

<h3>AIR.</h3>
<p>We all know very well that we can not live without
breathing.</p>
<p>What we do not all know, or do not all think of, is that we
want not only air, but good air. We are apt to take it for
granted that any air will do for us; stale air, dirty air, even
poisonous air.</p>
<p>What makes the matter worse is, that we can not help spoiling
air ourselves by the very act of breathing.</p>
<p>If people are shut up in rooms where the bad air can not get
out and the good air can not get in at all, they are sure to be
made ill.</p>
<p>Some people in Scotland thought they would have a merry
Christmas party, and invited their friends to come to a
dance.</p>
<p>As it was very cold weather, they shut all the doors and
windows tight, and then they began to dance.</p>
<p>It was a small room with a low ceiling, and there were
thirty-six people dancing in it all night. By the time morning
came the air was so bad that it was really like poison; and very
soon seven of the poor dancers were seized with a terrible fever,
and two of them actually died.</p>
<p>The air we breathe out is different from the air we take in.
We send away some things with our breath which were not in the
air when we took it in.</p>
<p>One of these is water. Sometimes you can see this for
yourself. On a cold, frosty day, you know we can see the clouds
of steam coming out of our mouths. This steam is only very fine
particles of water.</p>
<p>In warm weather we do not see the steam, but the water is
there all the same; if you will breathe on a looking-glass at any
time, you will make it dim and damp directly with the water that
is contained in your breath.</p>
<p>We also breathe out animal matter, little particles of our own
bodies just ready to decay. We can not see them, but they soon
give the air a close, disagreeable smell. Good air has no smell
at all.</p>
<p>And now I have something to say to you about the use of
noses.</p>
<p>I dare say you can not see much use in the sense of smell.
Seeing, hearing, touching, are very needful to us, we all know;
but as to smelling, that does not seem to have any particular
value.</p>
<p>It is pleasant to smell a sweet rose or violet; and, I
believe, smelling really forms a good part of what we call
tasting.</p>
<p>Of all our senses, smell is the one that soonest gets out of
practice. If people would always accustom themselves to use their
noses, they never would consent to live in the horrid air they
do.</p>
<p>If you go from the fresh air into a close room, you will
notice the smell at once. Then, if you remain there, you will
soon get accustomed to the smell and not notice it; but it will
still be there, and will be doing you a great deal of harm.</p>
<p>In good air there are, mainly, two sorts of gas.</p>
<p>The first is a very lively sort of gas, called oxygen; it is
very fond of joining itself with other things, and burning them,
and things burn very fast indeed in oxygen.</p>
<p>The second is a very slow, dull gas, called nitrogen; and
nothing will burn in it at all. Pure oxygen would be too active
for us to live in, so it is mixed with nitrogen.</p>
<p>When we breathe, the air goes down into our lungs, which are
something like sponges, inside our chests.</p>
<p>These sponges have in them an immense quantity of little
blood-vessels, and great numbers of little air-vessels; so that
the blood almost touches the air; there is only a very, very thin
skin between them.</p>
<p>Through that skin, the blood sends away the waste and useless
things it has collected from all parts of the body, and takes in
the fresh oxygen which the body wants.</p>
<p>You have often heard man's life compared to a candle. I will
show you some ways in which they are much alike.</p>
<p>When a candle or lamp burns, if we keep it from getting any
new air, it soon uses all the lively gas, or oxygen, and then it
goes out. This is easily shown by placing a glass jar over a
lighted candle.</p>
<p>If the candle gets only a little fresh air, it burns dim and
weak. If we get only a little fresh air, we are sickly and
weak.</p>
<p>The candle makes another kind of gas. It is called carbonic
acid gas, which, is unhealthy and not fit for breathing. The heat
of our bodies also makes this gas, and we throw it off in our
breath.</p>
<p>Oxygen and carbon, in a separate condition, make up a good
part of our flesh, blood, and bones; but when they are joined
together, and make carbonic acid gas, they are of no further use
to us.</p>
<p>You might go to a store and buy sand and sugar; but if they
became mixed together as you brought them home, you would not be
able to use either one of them, unless some clever fairy could
pick them apart for you.</p>
<p>You see now one great way of spoiling the air. How are we to
get rid of this bad air, and obtain fresh air, without being too
cold?</p>
<p>In summer time this is quite simple, but in winter it is more
difficult; because it is a very bad thing to be cold, and a thin,
cold draught of air is especially bad.</p>
<p>The bad air loaded with carbonic acid gas, when we first
breathe it out, is warm. Warm gases are much lighter than cold
ones, therefore the bad air at first goes up to the ceiling.</p>
<p>If there is an opening near the top of the room, the bad air
goes out; but if there is no opening, it by and by grows cold and
heavy, and comes down again. Then we have to breathe it.</p>
<p>If you open the window at the top, it will let out the bad
air, and you will not feel a draught. It is not often so very
cold that you cannot bear the window open, even a little way from
the top, and that is the best way of airing a room.</p>
<p>This is just as necessary by night as by day. People who shut
in the bad air, and shut out the good air, all night long, can
never expect to awake refreshed, feeling better for their
sleep.</p>
<p>What becomes of the carbonic acid gas which the body throws
off through our breath? Can any thing pick the carbon and oxygen
in it apart, and make them fit for us to use again?</p>
<p>Yes. Every plant, every green leaf, every blade of grass, does
that for us. When the sun shines on them, they pick the carbon
out and send back the oxygen for us to breathe. They keep the
carbon and make that fit for us and animals to eat.</p>
<p>The grass makes the carbon fit for sheep and cows, and then we
eat their flesh or drink their milk; and the corn makes the
carbon fit to eat; so do potatoes, and all the other vegetables
and fruits which we eat. Is not this a wonderful arrangement?</p>
<p>But perhaps you think, considering what an amazing number of
people there are in the world, besides all the animals&mdash;for
all creatures that breathe, spoil the air just as we
do&mdash;there can hardly be trees and plants enough to set all
the air right again.</p>
<p>Round about cities and large towns there are certainly more
people than there are trees, but in many other parts of the world
there are a great many more trees than there are people.</p>
<p>I have heard of forests in South America so thick and so
large, that the monkeys might run along the tops of the trees for
a hundred miles. So you see there are plenty of trees in the
world to do the work.</p>
<p>But then, how does all the bad air leave the towns and cities
where men live, and get to the forests and meadows?</p>
<p>The air is constantly moving about; rising and falling,
sweeping this way or that way, and traveling from place to
place.</p>
<p>Not only the little particles out of our breath, but any thing
that gives the air any smell, does it some harm. Even nice
smells, like those of roses, are unhealthy, if shut up in a room
for some time.</p>
<p>Dirty walls, ceilings, and floors give the air a musty, close,
smell; so do dirty clothes, muddy boots, cooking, and washing.
Some of these ought not to be in the house at all; others remind
us to open our windows wide.</p>
<p>All the things I have been saying to you about pure air, apply
still more to sick people than to healthy ones.</p>

<h3>A TIMELY RESCUE.</h3>
<br />
<p>It was in the month of February, 1831, a bright moonlight
night, and extremely cold, that the little brig I commanded lay
quietly at her anchors inside the bay.</p>
<p>We had had a hard time of it, beating about for eleven days,
with cutting north-easters blowing, and snow and sleet falling
for the greater part of the time.</p>
<p>When at length we made the port, all hands were almost
exhausted, and we could not have held out two days longer without
relief.</p>
<p>"A bitter cold night, Mr. Larkin," I said to my mate, as I
tarried for a moment on deck to finish my pipe. "The tide is
running out swift and strong; it will be well to keep a sharp
look-out for this floating ice, Mr. Larkin."</p>
<p>"Ay, ay, sir," answered the mate, and I went below.</p>
<p>Two hours afterwards I was aroused from a sound sleep by the
vigilant officer. "Excuse me for disturbing you, captain," said
he, as he detected an expression of vexation on my face; "but I
wish you would turn out, and come on deck as soon as
possible."</p>
<p>"Why&mdash;what's the matter, Mr. Larkin?"</p>
<p>"Why, sir, I have been watching a cake of ice that swept by at
a little distance a moment ago; I saw something black upon
it&mdash;something that I thought moved."</p>
<p>We were on deck before either spoke another word. The mate
pointed out, with no little difficulty, the cake of ice floating
off to leeward, and its white, glittering surface was broken by a
black spot.</p>
<p>"Get me a spy-glass, Mr. Larkin&mdash;the moon will be out of
that cloud in a moment, and then we can see distinctly." I kept
my eye on the receding mass of ice, while the moon was slowly
working its way through a heavy bank of clouds.</p>
<p>The mate stood by with a spy-glass. When the full light fell
at last upon the water, I put the glass to my eye. One glance was
enough..</p>
<p>"Forward, there!" I shouted at the top of my voice; and with,
one bound I readied the main hatch, and began to clear away the
ship's cutter. Mr. Larkin had received the glass from my hand to
take a look for himself.</p>
<p>"O, pitiful sight!" he said in a whisper, as he set to work to
aid me in getting out the boat; "there are two children on that
cake of ice!"</p>
<p>In a very short space of time we launched the cutter, into
which Mr. Larkin and myself jumped, followed by two men, who took
the oars. I held the tiller, and the mate sat beside me.</p>
<p>"Do you see that cake of ice with something black upon it,
lads?" I cried; "put me alongside of that, and I will give you a
month's extra wages when you are paid off."</p>
<p>The men were worn out by the hard duty of the preceding
fortnight; and, though they did their best, the boat made little
more way than the tide. This was a long chase; and Mr. Larkin,
who was suffering as he saw how little we gained, cried
out&mdash;</p>
<p>"Pull, lads&mdash;I'll double the captain's prize. Pull, lads,
for the sake of mercy, pull!"</p>
<p>A convulsive effort at the oars told how willing the men were
to obey, but their strength was gone. One of the poor fellows
splashed us twice in recovering his oar, and then gave out; the
other was nearly as far gone. Mr. Larkin sprung forward and
seized the deserted oar.</p>
<p>"Lie down in the bottom of the boat," said he to the man;
"and, captain, take the other oar; we must row for ourselves." I
took the second man's place.</p>
<p>Larkin had stripped to his Guernsey shirt; as he pulled the
bow I waited the signal stroke. It came gently, but firmly; and
the next moment we were pulling a long, steady stroke, gradually
increasing in rapidity until the wood seemed to smoke in the
oar-locks.</p>
<p>We kept time with each other by our long, deep breathing. Such
a pull! At every stroke the boat shot ahead like an arrow. Thus
we worked at the oars for fifteen minutes&mdash;it seemed to me
as many hours.</p>
<p>"Have we almost come to it, Mr. Larkin?" I asked.</p>
<p>"Almost, captain,&mdash;don't give up: for the love of our
dear little ones at home, don't give up, captain," replied
Larkin.</p>
<p>The oars flashed as the blades turned up to the moonlight. The
men who plied them were fathers, and had fathers' hearts; the
strength which nerved them at that moment was more than
human.</p>
<p>Suddenly Mr. Larkin stopped pulling, and my heart for a moment
almost ceased its beating; for the terrible thought that he had
given out crossed my mind. But I was quickly reassured by his
saying&mdash;</p>
<p>"Gently, captain, gently&mdash;a stroke or two
more&mdash;there, that will do"&mdash;and the next moment the
boat's side came in contact with something.</p>
<p>Larkin sprung from the boat upon the ice. I started up, and,
calling upon the men to make fast the boat to the ice,
followed.</p>
<p>We ran to the dark spot in the centre of the mass, and found
two little boys&mdash;the head of the smaller nestling in the
bosom of the larger. Both were fast asleep!</p>
<p>They were benumbed with cold, and would surely have frozen to
death, but for our timely rescue.</p>
<p>Mr. Larkin grasped one of the lads, cut off his shoes, tore
off his jacket; and then, loosening his own garments to the skin,
placed the chilled child in contact with his own warm body,
carefully wrapping over him his great-coat.</p>
<p>I did the same with the other child; and we then returned to
the boat; and the men having partly recovered, pulled slowly
back.</p>
<p>The children, as we learned when we afterwards had the delight
of returning them to their parents, were playing on the ice, and
had ventured on the cake.</p>
<p>A movement of the tide set the ice in motion, and the little
fellows were borne away on that cold night, and would certainly
have perished, had not Mr. Larkin seen them as the ice was
sweeping out to sea.</p>
<p>"How do you feel?" I said to the mate, the next morning after
this adventure.</p>
<p>"A little stiff in the arms, captain," the noble fellow
replied, while the big tears of grateful happiness gushed from
his eyes&mdash;"a little stiff in the arms, captain, but very
easy here," and he laid his hand on his manly heart.</p>

<h3>TRUE COURTESY.&mdash;PART I.</h3>
<p>Prince George, the husband of Queen Anne of England, one time
visited the town of Bristol, having with him as a companion, an
officer of his household.</p>
<p>While strolling about the town, looking at the people and the
quaint old buildings, they stepped into the Exchange, where all
the great merchants of the town had come together doing
business.</p>
<p>Prince George walked about, talking quite freely, first to one
and then to another. As the towns-people had not expected him, no
preparation had been made to receive him with honor; and the
merchants stood in little groups, and consulted together with, a
look of anxiety upon their faces.</p>
<p>"What is to be done?" asked one.</p>
<p>"I do not know," replied another. "If his Royal Highness does
not give us notice of his coming, how can we entertain him in a
proper manner?"</p>
<p>"Would it be well to ask him to come to one of our homes?"
inquired a third.</p>
<p>"No, no!" cried another. "We could not ask him to partake of
our humble fare, or even come to our homes, after the splendor to
which he has been accustomed. For my part, I shall go home to
dinner."</p>
<p>"And I also," said the first one. "I do not care to remain
here, and stare at the Prince, when we have nothing to
offer."</p>
<p>Then one by one, the merchants slipped away, afraid or ashamed
to ask the great Prince to their homes.</p>
<p>Prince George and the officer wondered at seeing the merchants
disappear. At last there was but one man left, and as he walked
toward the Prince, he bowed low, and said&mdash;</p>
<p>"Excuse me, sir; are you the husband of our Queen Anne, as
folks here say you are?"</p>
<p>"Yes, I am," was the answer; "and have come for a few hours to
see the sights of the good town of Bristol."</p>
<p>"Sir," said the man, "I have seen with much distress that none
of our great merchants have invited you to their homes. Think
not, sir, that it is because they are wanting in love and
loyalty. They doubtless were all afraid to ask one so high as
yourself to dine with them.</p>
<p>"I am one John Duddlestone, sir, only a bodice-maker, and I
pray you not to take it amiss if I ask you and the gentleman who
is with, you, to come to my humble home, where you will be most
welcome."</p>
<p>"Indeed," answered the Prince, laughing, "I am only too
delighted to accept your kind invitation, and I thank you for it
very heartily. If you lead the way, we will follow at once."</p>
<p>So Prince George, the officer, and Duddlestone, passed out of
the Exchange together.</p>
<p>"Ours is but humble fare," said Duddlestone; "for, sir, I can
offer you only roast beef and plum-pudding."</p>
<p>"Very good, very good indeed!" exclaimed the Prince; "it is
food to which I bring a hearty appetite."</p>
<p>They stopped before a small house. John pulled the latch, and,
walking in, looked for his wife; but she was upstairs.</p>
<p>"Here, wife, wife!" he called in a loud whisper, as he put his
head up the narrow staircase; "put on a clean apron, and make
haste and come down, for the Queen's husband and a
soldier-gentleman have come to dine with, us."</p>
<p>As you may think, Mrs. Duddlestone was strangely surprised at
the news; but she did not become excited; she very seldom did, I
believe.</p>
<p>"Ay, ay!" she called. "I'm coming;" and then muttered, "The
Queen's husband! the Queen's husband! Sure, that can never
be&mdash;however, I'll go down and see."</p>
<p>She ran to her closet, and pulled out a nice, clean apron and
cap, and tied, the one round her waist, and the other round her
comely face, saying all the time, "Dear me, dear me, to think of
it!" and away she ran down stairs, where stood her husband and
the two gentlemen.</p>
<p>The good woman bowed low, first to one and then to the
other.</p>
<p>"Indeed, but I'm proud," she said, turning to Prince George,
"to welcome you to our home. 'Tis but poor and humble, but we
shall think more of it after this. I'll hurry and get dinner at
once. I dare say you are hungry, gentlemen."</p>
<p>Prince George laughed gayly, as he thanked her for her kind
welcome, and sat down.</p>
<p>The table was soon spread, and the Prince ate well, and
appeared to enjoy himself so much, that Mrs. Duddlestone could
scarcely believe he had always been accustomed to lords and
ladies and footmen, and had never before sat down in such an
humble way.</p>
<p>Prince George inquired about their business and pleasures.</p>
<p>"Do you never come up to London?" he asked; "I think you would
find it worth your while to take a holiday some time, and see the
great city."</p>
<p>"Ah well," said Mrs. Duddlestone, "if that is not just the
thing I long for. I've never been yet, nor am I likely to go, but
John has been once or twice."</p>
<p>"And why, John, have you never taken your wife as well, to see
the great sights?"</p>
<p>"Well, to say the truth," answered John, "I do not go to see
the sights; for though I've been two or three times, I don't
think I've seen any.</p>
<p>"I must needs go sometimes to buy whalebone, and other trifles
which I must have for my business here. So I just go and come
back, and meddle with none."</p>
<p>"Well, well," said the Prince, "the next time you come to
London, you must bring your wife with you, and pay me a
visit."</p>
<p>Mrs. Duddlestone clasped her fat little hands with
delight.</p>
<p>"And shall I see the Queen?" she exclaimed.</p>
<p>"And see both the Queen and myself," answered the Prince.
"Come, John, say you will do so!"</p>
<p>"Surely, sir," said John, "I should like to give the good
woman a bit of pleasure in that way, but your grand servants
would shut the doors before us, and never let us in,
perhaps."</p>
<p>"I can soon set that right!" and taking a card from his
pocket, Prince George wrote a few words on it, and gave it to
them.</p>
<p>"That will gain you ready admission," he said, "and now I must
leave you. Next time we meet, I shall entertain and care for you.
For the present, I thank you for your kind welcome and good
dinner, which I have heartily enjoyed."</p>
<p>Then rising, he and the officer bade farewell to the good
people and took their leave.</p>

<h3>TRUE COURTESY.&mdash;PART II.</h3>
<p>It was some weeks later that John Duddlestone found his stock
of whalebone was growing low.</p>
<p>"Wife," said he, "the whalebone's nearly gone, and I must have
some more at once."</p>
<p>"Surely, John, I know well it's nearly gone!" she answered.
"Haven't I watched every bit as you've used it? and haven't I
pretty near cried to see it go so slowly?"</p>
<p>"Pooh! you foolish woman!" he cried.</p>
<p>"But, John, you'll take me, and go to see the King and Queen?"
she inquired.</p>
<p>"Why, you silly woman, do you think I should leave you behind,
when I know you're nearly crazed to go?"</p>
<p>"O John, John, you dear, good man! I've mended all my dresses,
and made myself trim and neat. I've seen to your coats; and all's
done; and I feel as if I could scarcely live till I see the
Queen."</p>
<p>"You'd best keep alive," said her husband; "and if all goes
well we'll start by the coach on Monday."</p>
<p>Monday was as lovely a day as heart could wish; and John and
his wife walked down the Bristol streets to the public-house from
which the coach was to start.</p>
<p>It was a great event in Mrs. Duddlestone's life, for she had
never been beyond her own town, except for a drive into the
country in a neighbor's cart.</p>
<p>They were quiet people; but it had got about the town, that
they were going to London to visit the Queen, and numbers came
out to see them go.</p>
<p>Perhaps some of the great merchants wished they had been
simple and humble enough to offer to entertain Prince George when
he had visited their town.</p>
<p>They journeyed straight to London, where John bought his
whalebone, and then found their way to St. James' Palace, where,
presenting the Prince's card, they gained ready admittance.</p>
<p>They were shown into a room, more beautiful than any that they
had ever seen. Very shortly the door opened, and the
well-remembered face of their guest appeared. Almost before he
had greeted them, a quiet-looking lady followed him, and came
smilingly to greet them.</p>
<p>"This is the Queen," said Prince George; and then, turning to
her, he added, "These are the good people who showed me such
kindness in Bristol."</p>
<p>The Queen was so gentle and courteous that neither John nor
his wife felt confused in her presence. She talked kindly to
them, asking after their trade, and how they had fared in their
journey.</p>
<p>She then asked them to dine with her that evening, and said
dresses would be provided for them, so that they should not feel
strange by seeing that they were dressed differently from all her
other guests.</p>
<p>She then called an attendant, and desired that refreshment
should be given them, and that they should be well cared for, and
shown all that might interest them until dinner time.</p>
<p>It was a long, wonderful day to them, as they walked about
from place to place. Before dinner they were taken to the room
that was prepared for them, and there they found elegant court
dresses of purple velvet ready to put on.</p>
<p>"Surely, John, they can not be for us!" cried Mrs.
Duddlestone.</p>
<p>"Yes, but they must be! Did not the Queen say she would give
us dresses? and do not these dresses look as if they had been
given by a queen?"</p>
<p>"John, I shall feel very strange before all the grand
ladies!"</p>
<p>"Then you need not, wife, for the Queen and Prince will be
there; and the others will not trouble you; but this is a queer
dress. It's like being somebody else."</p>
<p>And very queer they felt, as for the first time they walked
down the grand stairs, in such, splendid dresses, to dine at the
Queen's table, with the Queen's servants to wait on them.</p>
<p>"You must go first, John," said his wife, for shyness came
over her.</p>
<p>"Be not so foolish, wife," whispered John; and, though feeling
rather awkward in his new dress, he walked simply forward, as he
might have done in a friend's house.</p>
<p>The Queen met them at the door, and, turning to her other
guests, who were assembled, she said, "Gentlemen, I have to
introduce to you, with great pleasure, the most loyal people in
the town of Bristol."</p>
<p>At these words they all rose and bowed low, while John and his
wife did the same, and then sat down, and ate a good dinner.</p>
<p>After the dinner was over, the Prince summoned John
Duddlestone to the Queen.</p>
<p>At her command John knelt before her, and she laid a sword
lightly on his shoulder, with the words, "Rise up, Sir John
Duddlestone"; and the simple, kind-hearted bodice-maker of
Bristol rose up a knight.</p>
<p>His wife stood by, watching with eagerness, and could hardly
believe that from plain Mistress Duddlestone she had become Lady
Duddlestone.</p>
<p>She would, have been very proud if the Queen had laid the
sword upon her also; but she heard that was not needed. However,
she was made very happy by being called to the Queen's side.</p>
<p>"Lady Duddlestone," said Her Majesty, "allow me to present you
with my gold watch, in remembrance of your visit to St. James'
Palace, and of the Prince's visit to Bristol, which led to our
knowing two such loyal and courteous subjects."</p>
<p>Lady Duddlestone bowed lower and lower, almost unable to find
any words in which to express her gratitude.</p>
<p>A gold watch! Was it possible? Watches were not common in
those times. She had heard of watches, and had even seen some;
but had never dreamt of possessing one.</p>
<p>Such a big beauty it was! She was glad to fall back behind the
other guests, and get time to think quietly, and realize that all
was true, and not a dream from which she would wake, and find
herself in her little attic bed-room at Bristol.</p>
<p>Queen Anne then spoke to Sir John, offering to give him a
position under Government; but he begged to be excused.</p>
<p>"It would be strange, your Majesty, very strange, up in
London, and my work at Bristol suits me far the best. We want for
nothing, and should never feel so well and home-like as in our
little house at Bristol."</p>
<p>The Queen understood him, and did not press him; and in
another day or two the couple were again on their way home.</p>
<p>"You're glad, wife, that we're going home?" John asked; "and
you think I did well not to take some office in London?"</p>
<p>"Well! You could have clone no better. It's been grand to see,
and grand to hear; but it would be very strange and uncomfortable
to live always like that, and I'll be right glad to be back once
more.</p>
<p>"I'm more than proud of it all. But I should never like our
own room, in which Prince George sat so home-like with us, to
belong to another."</p>
<p>"No, no&mdash;we will keep our own snug home," replied John
with earnestness.</p>
<p>And so they did, living on quietly as of old; and the only
display ever made by Lady Duddlestone was, that whenever she went
to church or to market, she always wore the Queen's big gold
watch.</p>

<h3>WHY AN APPLE FALLS.</h3>
<p>"Father," said Lucy, "I have been reading to-day that Sir
Isaac Newton was led to make a great discovery, by seeing an
apple fall from a tree. What was there wonderful about the apple
falling?"</p>
<p>"Nothing very wonderful in that," replied her father; "but it
set him to thinking of what made it fall."</p>
<p>"Why, I could have told him that," said Lucy; "because the
stem snapped and there was nothing to support it."</p>
<p>"And what then?" asked her father.</p>
<p>"Why, then, of course it must fall."</p>
<p>"Ah!" said her father, "that is the point: why must it
fall?"</p>
<p>"I am sure I don't know," said Lucy. "I presume it was because
there was nothing to keep it up."</p>
<p>"Well, Lucy, suppose there was not&mdash;does it follow that
it must come to the ground?"</p>
<p>"Yes, certainly," replied Lucy, wonderingly.</p>
<p>"Let us see," said her father; "but first answer this
question: What is an animate object?"</p>
<p>"Any thing that has animal life, and power to move at will,"
replied Lucy.</p>
<p>"Very good," said her father; "now, what is an inanimate
object?"</p>
<p>"Any thing that does not possess animal life, or can not move
at will."</p>
<p>"Very good again," said her father. "Now an apple is, of
course, an inanimate object; and therefore it could not move
itself, and Sir Isaac Newton thought that he would try to find
out what power moved it."</p>
<p>"Well, then," said Lucy; "did he find that the apple fell,
because it was forced to fall?"</p>
<p>"Yes," replied her father; "he found that there was some force
outside of the apple itself that acted upon it, otherwise it
would have remained forever where it was, no matter if it were
detached from the tree."</p>
<p>"Would it, indeed?" asked Lucy.</p>
<p>"Yes, without doubt," replied her father, "for there are only
two ways in which it could be moved&mdash;by its own power of
motion, or the power of something else moving it. Now the first
power, you know it does not have; so the cause of its motion must
be the second."</p>
<p>"But every thing falls to the ground as well as an apple, when
there is nothing to keep it up," said Lucy.</p>
<p>"True. There must therefore be some power or force which
causes things to fall," said her father.</p>
<p>"And what is it?" asked Lucy.</p>
<p>"If things away from the earth can not move themselves to it,"
said her father, "there can be no other cause of their falling
than that the earth pulls them."</p>
<p>"But," said Lucy, "the earth is no more animate than they are;
so how can it pull?"</p>
<p>"That is not an ordinary question, but I will try an
explanation," said her father. "Sir Isaac Newton discovered that
there was a law in nature called attraction, and that all bodies
exert this force upon each other. The greater the body, the
greater is its power of attraction.</p>
<p>"Now, the earth is an immense mass of matter, with which
nothing near it can compare in size. It draws therefore with
mighty force all things within its reach, which is the cause of
their falling. Do you understand this?"</p>
<p>"I think that I do," said Lucy; "the earth is like a great
magnet."</p>
<p>"Yes," said her father; "but the attraction of the magnet is
of a particular kind and is only over iron, while the attraction
of the earth acts upon every thing alike."</p>
<p>"Then it is pulling you and me at this moment!" said Lucy.</p>
<p>"Certainly it is," replied her father; "and as I am the
larger, it is pulling me with more force than it is pulling you.
This attraction is what gives every thing weight.</p>
<p>"If I lift up any thing, I am acting against this force, for
which reason the article seems heavy; and the more matter it
contains, the greater is the force of attraction and the heavier
it appears to me."</p>
<p>"Then," said Lucy, "if this attraction is so powerful, why do
we not stick to the ground?"</p>
<p>"Because," replied her father, "we are animate beings, and
have the power of motion, by which, to a limited degree, we
overcome the attraction of the earth."</p>
<p>"Well then, father," said Lucy, "if our power of motion can
overcome the attraction, why can not we jump a mile high as well
as a foot?"</p>
<p>"Because," replied her father, "as I said before, we can only
overcome the attraction to a certain extent. As soon as the force
our muscles give to the jump is spent, the attraction of the
earth pulls us back."</p>
<p>"Did Sir Isaac Newton think of all these things, because he
saw the apple fall?" inquired Lucy.</p>
<p>"Yes; of all these and many more. He was a man of great
knowledge. The name by which the force he discovered is generally
known, is the Attraction of Gravitation, and some time you will
learn how this force keeps the earth, and the sun, moon, and
stars, all in their places."</p>

<h3>THE JAGUAR.</h3>
<p>The jaguar, or as he is sometimes called, the American tiger,
is the largest and most ferocious of the cat family found on this
continent.</p>
<p>Some jaguars have been seen equal in size to the Asiatic
tiger; but in most cases the American, animal is smaller. He is
strong enough, however, to drag a horse or an ox to his
den&mdash;sometimes to a long distance; and this feat has been
frequently observed.</p>
<p>The jaguar is found in all the tropical parts of North and
South America.</p>
<p>While he bears a considerable likeness to the tiger, both in
shape and habits, the markings of his skin are quite different.
Instead of being striped like the tiger, the skin of the jaguar
is beautifully spotted.</p>
<p>Each spot resembles a rosette, and consists of a black ring
with a single dark-colored spot in the middle.</p>
<p>Jaguars are not always of the same color; some have skins of
an orange color, and these are the most beautiful. Others are
lighter colored; and some few have been seen that were very
nearly white.</p>
<p>There, is a "black jaguar," which is thought to be of a
different species. It is larger and fiercer than the other kinds,
and is found only in South America.</p>
<p>This animal is more dreaded by the inhabitants than the other
kinds and is said always to attack man wherever it may encounter
him. All the other beasts fear it.</p>
<p>Its roar produces terror and confusion among them and causes
them to flee in every direction. It is never heard by the natives
without a feeling of fear, and no wonder; for a year does not
pass without a number of these people falling victims to its
ferocity.</p>
<p>It is difficult for one living in a country where such fierce
animals are unknown, to believe that they have an influence over
man, to such an extent as to prevent his settling in a particular
place; yet such is the fact.</p>
<p>In many parts of South America, not only plantations, but
whole villages, have been abandoned solely from fear of the
jaguars.</p>
<p>There are men, however, who can deal single-handed with the
jaguar; and who do not fear to attack the brute in its own
haunts.</p>
<p>They do not trust to fire-arms, but to a sharp spear. On their
left arm they carry a strong shield.</p>
<p>This shield is held forward and is usually seized by the
jaguar. While it is busied with this, the hunter thrusts at the
animal with his sharp spear, and generally with deadly
effect.</p>
<p>A traveler in South America relates the following incident as
having come under his observation:</p>
<p>"Desiring to witness a jaguar hunt, I employed two well-known
Indian hunters, and set out for the forest. The names of these
hunters were Ni&ntilde;o and Guapo. Both of them had long been
accustomed to hunt the jaguar, and I felt perfectly safe in their
company.</p>
<p>"Guapo, the larger of the two, was a man of wonderful muscular
power, and had the reputation of having at one time killed a
black jaguar with only a stout club.</p>
<p>"When all the preparations had been made for our start, we
looked as if we might capture all the jaguars that came in our
way.</p>
<p>"Some hours after we had entered the forest, the quick eye of
Guapo discovered the trail of a large jaguar which he assured me
was recently made.</p>
<p>"Stopping for a moment, both Guapo and Ni&ntilde;o looked
carefully about in every direction, and listened attentively, in
order that they might see or hear the animal if he were near.</p>
<p>"Then motioning me to follow at a little distance behind them,
they stepped off quietly in the direction of the trail, Guapo
being about thirty feet in advance of Ni&ntilde;o.</p>
<p>"We went forward in this manner several hundred yards, not a
word being spoken, and the keen eyes of both the hunters
constantly on the alert.</p>
<p>"Guapo, in the meantime, who seemed to have no fear and became
more and more excited as he approached to where he thought the
animal must be, had increased the distance between himself and
Ni&ntilde;o considerably.</p>
<p>"Suddenly a terrific roar, and at the same time a cry of pain
and a shout, warned us that Guapo had met the jaguar.</p>
<div class="figright"><img alt="jaguar hunt (65K)" src=
"images/183.jpg" height="500" width="413" /></div>
<p>"Ni&ntilde;o bounded forward, and I followed as quickly as I
could. A fearful sight met our eyes!</p>
<p>"The jaguar, which had been hiding in the branches of a large
tree, had sprung down upon Guapo and fastened its terrible teeth
in his thigh.</p>
<p>"With a shout filled with fury and determination, Ni&ntilde;o
at once sprung forward and savagely attacked the beast with his
spear.</p>
<p>"This caused the jaguar to let go its hold of Guapo, who, made
furious from the pain of the wound the animal had given him,
turned, and with his spear attacked it with a mad ferocity as
savage as that of the beast itself.</p>
<p>"In a moment all was over, and the jaguar lay dead at our feet.
I dressed Guapo's wound the best I could, while Ni&ntilde;o took
the skin from the body of the animal, which proved to be nearly
eight feet long.</p>
<p>"We returned very slowly to the village with the wounded man
and our prize. In a few weeks Guapo had entirely recovered from
his wounds, and was ready for another hunt."</p>

<h3>HOLLAND.&mdash;PART I.</h3>
<p>Holland is one of the queerest countries under the sun. It
should be called Odd-land, or Contrary-land; for, in nearly every
thing, it is different from other parts of the world.</p>
<p>In the first place, a large portion of the country is lower
than the level of the sea. Great dikes have been built at a heavy
cost of money and labor, to keep the ocean where it belongs.</p>
<p>On certain parts of the coast it sometimes leans with all its
weight against the land, and it is as much as the poor country
can do to stand the pressure.</p>
<p>Sometimes the dikes give way, or spring a leak, and the most
disastrous results follow. They are high and wide, and the tops
of some of them are covered with buildings and trees. They have
even fine public roads upon them, from which horses may look down
upon wayside cottages.</p>
<p>Often the keels of floating ships are higher than the roofs of
the dwellings. The stork, on the house-peak, may feel that her
nest is lifted far out of danger, but the croaking frog in the
neighboring bulrushes is nearer the stars than she.</p>
<p>Water-bugs dart backward and forward above the heads of the
chimney swallows; and willow-trees seem drooping with shame,
because they can not reach so high as the reeds near by.</p>
<p>Ditches, canals, ponds, rivers, and lakes are every-where to
be seen. High, but not dry, they shine in the sunlight, catching
nearly all the bustle and the business, quite scorning the tame
fields, stretching damply beside them. One is tempted to ask:
"Which is Holland&mdash;the shores or the water?"</p>
<p>The very verdure that should be confined to the land has made
a mistake and settled upon the fish ponds. In fact the entire
country is a kind of saturated sponge, or, as the English poet
Butler called it&mdash;</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>"A land that rides at anchor, and is moored,</p>
<p>In which they do not live, but go aboard."</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Persons are born, live, and die, and even have their gardens
on canal-boats. Farmhouses, with roofs like great slouched hats
pulled over their eyes, stand on wooden legs, with a tucked up
sort of air, as if to say, "We intend to keep dry if we can."</p>
<p>Even the horses wear a wide stool on each hoof to lift them
out of the mire.</p>
<p>It is a glorious country in summer for bare-footed girls and
boys. Such wadings! Such mimic ship sailing! Such rowing,
fishing, and swimming! Only think of a chain of puddles where one
can launch chip boats all day long, and never make a return
trip!</p>
<p>But enough. A full recital would set all Young America rushing
in a body toward the Zuyder Zee.</p>

<h3>HOLLAND.&mdash;PART II.</h3>
<p>Dutch cities seem, at first sight, to be a bewildering jumble
of houses, bridges, churches, and ships, sprouting into masts,
steeples, and trees. In some cities boats are hitched, like
horses, to their owners' door-posts, and receive their freight
from the upper windows.</p>
<div class="figright"><img alt="dutch_scene (80K)" src=
"images/189.jpg" height="500" width="382" /></div>
<p>Mothers scream to their children not to swing on the garden
gate for fear they may be drowned. Water roads are more frequent
there than common roads and railroads; water-fences, in the form
of lazy green ditches, inclose pleasure-ground, farm, and
garden.</p>
<p>Sometimes fine green hedges are seen; but wooden fences, such
as we have in America, are rarely met with in Holland. As for
stone fences, a Hollander would lift his hands with astonishment
at the very idea.</p>
<p>There is no stone there excepting those great masses of rock
that have been brought from other lands to strengthen and protect
the coast.</p>
<p>All the small stones or pebbles, if there ever were any, seem
to be imprisoned in pavements, or quite melted away. Boys, with
strong, quick arms, may grow from aprons to full beards without
ever finding one to start the water-rings, or set the rabbits
flying.</p>
<p>The water roads are nothing less than canals crossing the
country in every direction. These are of all sizes, from the
great North Holland Ship Canal, which is the wonder of the world,
to those which a boy can leap.</p>
<p>Water-omnibuses constantly ply up and down these roads for the
conveyance of passengers; and water-drays are used for carrying
fuel and merchandise.</p>
<p>Instead of green country lanes, green canals stretch from
field to barn, and from barn to garden; and the farms are merely
great lakes pumped dry. Some of the busiest streets are water,
while many of the country roads are paved with brick.</p>
<p>The city boats, with their rounded sterns, gilded bows, and
gayly-painted sides, are unlike any others under the sun; a Dutch
wagon with its funny little crooked pole is a perfect mystery of
mysteries.</p>
<p>One thing is clear, you may think that the inhabitants need
never be thirsty. But no, Odd-land is true to itself still. With
the sea pushing to get in, and the lakes struggling to get out,
and the overflowing canals, rivers, and ditches, in many
districts there is no water that is fit to swallow.</p>
<p>Our poor Hollanders must go dry, or send far inland for that
precious fluid, older than Adam, yet young as the morning
dew.</p>
<p>Sometimes, indeed, the inhabitants can swallow a shower, when
they are provided with any means of catching it; but generally
they are like the sailors told of in a famous poem, who saw</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>"Water, water, every-where,</p>
<p>Nor any drop to drink!"</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Great flapping windmills all over the country make it look as
if flocks of huge sea birds were just settling upon it.
Every-where one sees the funniest trees, bobbed into all sorts of
odd shapes, with their trunks painted a dazzling' white, yellow,
or red.</p>
<p>Horses are often yoked three abreast. Men, women, and
children, go clattering about in wooden shoes with loose
heels.</p>
<p>Husbands and wives lovingly harness themselves side by side on
the bank of the canal and drag their produce to market.</p>

<h3>THE WIND IN A FROLIC.</h3>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>The wind one morning sprung up from sleep,</p>
<p>Saying, "Now for a frolic! Now for a leap!</p>
<p>Now for a madcap galloping chase!</p>
<p>I'll make a commotion in every place!"</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>So it swept with a bustle right through a great town,</p>
<p>Creaking the signs and scattering down</p>
<p>Shutters, and whisking with merciless squalls,</p>
<p>Old women's bonnets and gingerbread stalls.</p>
<p>There never was heard a much lustier shout,</p>
<p>As the apples and oranges tumbled about.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>Then away to the fields it went blustering and humming,</p>
<p>And the cattle all wondered whatever was coming.</p>
<p>It pulled by their tails the grave, matronly cows,</p>
<p>And tossed the colts' manes all about their brows,</p>
<p>Till, offended at such a familiar salute,</p>
<p>They all turned their backs and stood silently mute.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>So on it went, capering and playing its pranks;</p>
<p>Whistling with reeds on the broad river banks;</p>
<p>Puffing the birds, as they sat on the spray,</p>
<p>Or the traveler grave on the king's highway.</p>
<p>It was not too nice to hustle the bags</p>
<p>Of the beggar, and flutter his dirty rags.</p>
<p>'Twas so bold that it feared not to play its joke</p>
<p>With the doctor's wig, and the gentleman's cloak.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>Through the forest it roared, and cried gayly, "Now</p>
<p>You sturdy old oaks, I'll make you bow!"</p>
<p>And it made them bow without more ado,</p>
<p>Or it cracked their great branches through and through.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>Then it rushed like a monster o'er cottage and farm,</p>
<p>Striking their inmates with sudden alarm;</p>
<p>And they ran out like bees in a midsummer swarm.</p>
<p>There were dames with their kerchiefs tied over their
caps,</p>
<p>To see if their poultry were free from mishaps;</p>
<p>The turkeys they gobbled, the geese screamed aloud,</p>
<p>And the hens crept to roost in a terrified crowd;</p>
<p>There was raising of ladders, and logs laying on,</p>
<p>Where the thatch from the roof threatened soon to be gone.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>But the wind had passed on, and had met in a lane</p>
<p>With a school-boy, who panted and struggled in vain;</p>
<p>For it tossed him, and whirled him, then passed, and he
stood</p>
<p>With his hat in a pool, and his shoe in the mud.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>Then away went the wind in its holiday glee,</p>
<p>And now it was far on the billowy sea;</p>
<p>And the lordly ships felt its powerful blow,</p>
<p>And the little boats darted to and fro.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>But, lo! it was night, and it sunk to rest</p>
<p>On the sea-birds' rock in the gleaming west,</p>

<h3>SOMETHING ABOUT PLANTS.</h3>
<p>The name plant belongs in a general way to all vegetation,
from the tiniest spear of grass or creeping flower one sees on
the rocks by the brook-side, to the largest and tallest of forest
trees.</p>
<p>Plants are divided into numerous groups of families, and the
study of the many species belonging to each family, is very
interesting.</p>
<p>There are thousands of kinds of grasses, shrubs, and trees,
scattered over the different parts of the earth, and the larger
portion of them are in some way useful to mankind.</p>
<p>In speaking of grasses, we are apt to think only of the grass
in the meadows, which is the food for our horses and cattle; but
there are other kinds of grasses which are just as important to
man as the grass of the meadow is to the beast. These are oats,
rye, barley, wheat, corn, and others, all of which belong to the
grass family.</p>
<p>Perhaps it appears strange to you to hear wheat and corn
called grass, and you ask how can that be.</p>
<p>In the first place, all plants that have the same general form
and method of growth, belong to the same family.</p>
<p>Now, if you will pull up a stalk of grass and a stalk of wheat
or rye and compare them, you will find that they are alike in all
important respects.</p>
<p>The roots of each look like a little bundle of strings or
fibers, and are therefore called fibrous; the stalks you will
find jointed and hollow; and the leaves are long and narrow,
tapering to a point at their ends.</p>
<p>Then, if you examine the seeds, you will see that they are
placed near together and form what we call an ear or head, as in
an ear of corn, or a head of wheat.</p>
<p>This same general form or structure applies to every one of
the plants belonging to the grass family; and in this family are
included all the different kinds of canes and reeds that grow in
swamps and marshy places, as well as the bamboo of the
tropics.</p>
<p>Shrubs are those plants which have woody stems and branches.
They are generally of small size, rarely reaching over twenty
feet in height. Small shrubs are usually called bushes.</p>
<p>In this class of plants, the branches generally start close to
the ground, and in some cases, a little below the surface of the
ground, rising and spreading out in all directions.</p>
<p>The common currant bushes, blackberry bushes, and rose bushes
which we see in gardens, are shrubs.</p>
<p>So also are grape-vines, honeysuckles, ivy, and all other
creeping vines. These are called climbing plants, because little
tendrils or claspers which grow out of their branches, wind
around and fasten themselves to any thing in their way.</p>
<p>Trees are the largest and strongest of all plants.</p>
<p>They have woody stems or trunks, and branches. These branches
do not, as in shrubs, start close to the ground, but at some
distance above, from which height they extend in different
directions.</p>
<p>It is difficult to believe that some of the large trees we
see, sprung from small seeds; yet it is true that all trees
started in this manner.</p>
<p>The seeds are scattered about by birds and tempests, and
falling on the soft ground, where they become covered with,
leaves and earth, they take root and grow.</p>
<p>Thus the little acorn sprouts, and from it springs the sturdy
oak, which is not only the noblest of trees, but lives hundreds
of years.</p>
<p>The trunks and branches of trees are protected by a covering
called bark. This bark is thicker near the base or root of the
tree than it is higher up among the branches.</p>
<p>On some trees, the bark is very rough and shaggy looking, as
on the oak, ash, walnut, and pine; on others, the bark is smooth,
as on the beech, apple, and birch.</p>
<p>Some trees live for only a few years, rapidly reaching their
full growth, and rapidly decaying. The peach-tree is one of this
kind.</p>
<p>Other trees live to a great age. An elm-tree has been known to
live for three hundred years; a chestnut-tree, six hundred years;
and oaks, eight hundred years.</p>
<p>The baobab-tree of Africa lives to be many hundred years old.
There is a yew-tree in England that is known to be over two
thousand years old.</p>
<p>The "big trees" of California are the largest in the world,
although not of so great an age as some that have been mentioned.
The tallest of these trees that has yet been discovered, measures
over three hundred and fifty feet in height, and the distance
around it near the ground is almost one hundred feet. The age of
this tree must be between one thousand five hundred and two
thousand years.</p>

<h3>A FOREST ON FIRE.&mdash;PART I.</h3>
<p>We were sound asleep one night, when, about two hours before
day, the snorting of our horses and lowing of our cattle, which
were ranging in the woods, suddenly awoke us.</p>
<p>I took my rifle and went to the door to see what beast had
caused the hubbub, when I was struck by the glare of light
reflected on all the trees before me, as far as I could see
through the woods.</p>
<p>My horses were leaping about, snorting loudly, and the cattle
ran among them in great confusion.</p>
<p>On going to the back of the house I plainly heard the
crackling made by the burning brushwood, and saw the flames
coming toward us in a far-extended line.</p>
<p>I ran to the house, told my wife to dress herself and the
child as quickly as possible, and take the little money we had,
while I managed to catch and saddle two of the best horses.</p>
<p>All this was done in a very short time, for I felt that every
moment was precious to us.</p>
<p>We then mounted our horses, and made off from the fire. My
wife, who is an excellent rider, kept close to me; and my
daughter, who was then a small child, I took in one arm.</p>
<p>When making off, I looked back and saw that the frightful
blaze was close upon us, and had already laid hold of the
house.</p>
<p>By good luck there was a horn attached to my hunting-clothes,
and I blew it, to bring after us, if possible, the remainder of
my live-stock, as well as the dogs.</p>
<p>The cattle followed for a while; but before an hour had passed
they all ran, as if mad, through the woods, and that was the last
we saw of them.</p>
<p>My dogs, too, although at all other times easily managed, ran
after the deer that in great numbers sprung before us as if fully
aware of the death, that was so rapidly approaching.</p>
<p>We heard blasts from the horns of our neighbors as we
proceeded, and knew that they were in the same unfortunate
condition that we were in ourselves.</p>
<p>Intent on striving to the utmost to preserve our lives, I
thought of a large lake, some miles off, where the flames might
possibly be checked, and we might find a place of safety.</p>
<p>Urging my wife to whip up her horse, we set off at full speed,
making the best way we could over the fallen trees and the brush
heaps, which lay like so many articles placed on purpose to keep
up the terrific fires that advanced with a broad front upon
us.</p>
<p>By this time we were suffering greatly from the effects of the
heat, and we were afraid that our horses would be overcome and
drop down at any moment.</p>
<p>A singular kind of breeze was passing over our heads, and the
glare of the burning trees shone more brightly than the daylight.
I was sensible of a slight faintness, and my wife looked
pale.</p>
<p>The heat had produced such a flush in the child's face that,
when she turned toward either of us, our grief and anxiety were
greatly increased.</p>

<h3>A FOREST ON FIRE.&mdash;PART II.</h3>
<p>Ten miles are soon gone over on swift horses; but yet, when we
reached the borders of the lake we were quite exhausted, and our
hearts failed us. The heat of the smoke was insufferable, and
sheets of blazing fire<!-- Page 205 -->
flew over us in a manner beyond belief.</p>
<div class="figright"><img alt="fire (72K)" width="439" height=
"500" src="images/205.jpg" /></div>
<p>We reached the shore, however, coasted the lake for a while,
and got round to the sheltered side. There we gave up our horses,
which we never saw again.<!-- Page 206 --></p>
<p>We plunged down among the rushes, by the edge of the water,
and laid ourselves down flat, to await the chance of escaping
from being burned or devoured. The water greatly refreshed us,
and we enjoyed the coolness.</p>
<p>On went the fire, rushing and crashing through the woods. Such
a morning may we never again see! The heavens themselves, I
thought, were frightened.</p>
<p>All above us was a bright, red glare, mingled with, dark,
threatening clouds and black smoke, rolling and sweeping away in
the distance.</p>
<p>Our bodies were cool enough, but our heads were scorching; and
the child, who now seemed to understand the matter, cried so as
nearly to break our hearts.</p>
<p>The day passed on, and we became hungry. Many wild beasts came
plunging into the water beside us, and others swam across to our
side, and stood still. Although faint and weary, I managed to
shoot a porcupine, and we all tasted its flesh.</p>
<p>The night passed, I cannot tell you how. Smoldering fires
covered the ground, and the trees stood like pillars of fire, or
fell across each<!-- Page 207 -->
other.</p>
<p>The stifling and sickening smoke still rushed over us, and the
burnt cinders and ashes fell thick around us.</p>
<p>When morning came, every thing about us was calm; but a dismal
smoke still filled the air, and the smell seemed worse than ever.
What was to become of us I did not know.</p>
<p>My wife hugged the child to her breast, and wept bitterly; but
God had preserved us through the worst of the danger, and the
flames had gone past, so I thought it would be both ungrateful to
Him and unmanly to despair now.</p>
<p>Hunger once more pressed upon us, but this was soon remedied.
Several deer were standing in the water, up to the head, and I
shot one of them. Some of its flesh was soon roasted, and after
eating it we felt wonderfully strengthened.</p>
<p>By this time the blaze of the burning forest was beyond our
sight, although the remains of the fires of the night before were
still burning in many places, and it was dangerous to go among
the burnt trees.<!-- Page 208 --></p>
<p>After resting for some time, we prepared to commence our
march. Taking up the child in my arms, I led the way over the hot
ground and rocks; and after two weary days and nights of
suffering, during which we shifted in the best manner we could,
we at last succeeded in reaching the hard woods, which had been
free from the fire.</p>
<p>Soon after we came to a house, where we were kindly treated.
Since then I have worked hard and constantly as a lumber-man;
and, thanks to God, we are safe, sound, and happy.</p>

<h3>A GHOST STORY.&mdash;PART I.</h3>
<p>"I have not a room in the house; but if you don't mind going
down to the cottage, and coming up here to your meals, I can take
you, and would be glad to," said Mrs. Grant, in answer to my
request for board.</p>
<p>"Where is the cottage?" and I looked about me, feeling ready
to accept any thing in the way of shelter, after the long, hot
journey from Boston to breezy York Harbor.</p>
<p>"Right down there&mdash;just a step, you see. It's all in
order; and next week it will be full, for many folks prefer it
because of the quiet."</p>
<p>At the end of a very steep path, which offered every chance
for<!-- Page 212 -->
accidents of all sorts, from a sprained ankle to a broken neck,
stood the cottage&mdash;a little white building, with a pretty
vine over the door, gay flowers in the garden, and the blue
Atlantic rolling up at the foot of the cliff.</p>
<p>"A regular 'Cottage by the Sea.' It will suit me exactly if I
can have the upper front room. I don't mind being alone; so have
my trunk taken down, please, and I'll get ready for tea," said I,
feeling very happy on account of my good luck.</p>
<p>Alas, how little I knew what a night of terror I was to pass
in that pretty white cottage!</p>
<p>An hour later, refreshed by my tea and the coolness of the
place, I plunged into the pleasures of the season, and accepted
two invitations for the evening&mdash;one to a, walk on Sunset
Hill, the other to a clam-bake on the beach.</p>
<p>The stroll came first, and on the hill-top we met an old
gentleman with a spy-glass, who welcomed me with the
remark&mdash;</p>
<p>"Pretty likely place for a prospect."</p>
<p>After replying to what he said, I asked the old gentleman if
he knew any legend or stories about the old houses all around us.
<!-- Page 213 --></p>
<p>"Yes, many of them," he replied; "and it isn't always the old
places that have the most stories about 'em.</p>
<p>"Why, that cottage down yonder isn't more'n fifty years old,
and they do say there's been a lot of ghosts seen there, owin' to
a man's killin' of himself in the back bed-room."</p>
<p>"What! that house at the end of the lane?" I asked, with
sudden interest.</p>
<p>"Just so; nice place, but lonesome and dampish. Ghosts and
toadstools are apt to locate in houses of that sort," was his
mild reply.</p>
<p>The dampness scared me more than the ghosts, for I had never
seen a ghost yet; but I had been haunted by rheumatism, and found
it a hard thing to get rid of.</p>
<p>"I've taken a room there, so I'm rather interested in knowing
what company I'm to have."</p>
<p>"Taken a room, have you? Well, I dare say you won't be
troubled. Some folks have a knack of seeing spirits, and then
again some haven't.<!-- Page 214 --></p>
<p>"My wife is uncommon powerful that way, but I an't; my sight's
dreadful poor for that sort."</p>
<p>There was such a sly look in the starboard eye of the old
fellow as he spoke, that I laughed outright, and asked,
sociably&mdash;</p>
<p>"Has she ever seen the ghosts of the cottage? I think I have
rather a knack that way, and I'd like to know what to
expect."</p>
<p>"No, her sort is the rapping kind. Down yonder, the only ghost
I take much stock in is old Bezee Tucker's. Some folks say
they've heard him groaning there nights, and a dripping sound; he
bled to death, you know.</p>
<p>"It was kept quiet at the time, and is forgotten now by all
but a few old fellows like me. Bezee was always polite to the
ladies, so I guess he won't bother you, ma'am;" and the old
fellow laughed.</p>
<p>"If he does, I'll let you know;" and with that I left him, for
I was called and told that the beach party was anxious for my
company.</p>
<p>In the delights of that happy hour, I<!-- Page 215 --> forgot
the warning of the old gentleman on the hill, for I was about to
taste a clam for the first time in my life, and it was a most
absorbing moment.</p>
<p>Perched about on the rocks like hungry birds, we sat and
watched the happy cooks with breathless interest, as they
struggled with frying-pans, fish that refused to brown, steaming
sea-weed, and hot ashes.</p>
<p>Little Margie Grant waited upon me so prettily, that I should
have been tempted to try a sea porcupine if she had offered it,
so charming was her way of saying, "O here's a perfectly lovely
one! Do take him by his little black head and eat him quick!"</p>
<p>I indulged without thought, in clams, served hot between two
shells, little dreaming what a price I was to pay for that
banquet.</p>

<h3>A GHOST STORY.&mdash;PART II.</h3>
<p>We staid up till late, and then I was left, at my own door by
my friends, who informed me that York was a very quiet, safe
place, where people slept with unlocked doors, and nothing ever
went amiss o' nights.</p>
<p>I said nothing of ghosts, being ashamed to own that I quaked,
a little at the idea of the "back bed-room," as I shut out the
friendly faces and fastened myself in.</p>
<p>A lamp and matches stood in the hall, and lighting the lamp, I
whisked up stairs with suspicious rapidity, locking my door, and
went to bed, firmly refusing to own even to myself that I had
ever heard the name of Bezee Tucker.<!-- Page 217 --></p>
<p>Being very tired, I soon fell asleep; but fried potatoes and a
dozen or two of hot clams are not kinds of food best fitted to
bring quiet sleep, so a fit of nightmare brought me to a
realizing sense of my foolishness.</p>
<p>From a chaos of wild dreams was finally brought forth a
gigantic clam, whose mission it was to devour me as I had
devoured its relatives. The sharp shells were open before me, and
a solemn voice said, "Take her by her little head and eat her
quick."</p>
<p>Retribution was at hand, and, with a despairing effort to
escape by diving, I bumped my head smartly against the wall, and
woke up feeling as if there was an earthquake under the bed.</p>
<p>Collecting my scattered wits, I tried to go to sleep again;
but alas! that fatal feast had destroyed sleep, and I vainly
tried to quiet my wakeful senses with the rustle of leaves about
the window and the breaking waves upon the beach.</p>
<p>In one of the pauses between the sounds of the waves, I heard
a curious noise in the house&mdash;a sort of moan, coming at
regular intervals.<!-- Page 218 --></p>
<p>And, as I sat up to make out where it was, another sound
caught my attentive ear. Drip, drip, drip, went something out in
the hall, and in an instant the tale told me on Sunset Hill came
back with unpleasant reality.</p>
<p>"Nonsense! It is raining, and the roof leaks," I said to
myself, while an unpleasant thrill went through me, and fancy,
aided by indigestion, began to people the house with ghostly
inmates.</p>
<p>No rain had fallen for weeks, and peeping through my curtain,
I saw the big, bright stars shining in a cloudless sky; so that
explanation failed, and still the drip, drip, drip went on.</p>
<p>Likewise the moaning&mdash;so distinctly now that it was clear
that the little back bed-room was next the chamber in which I was
quaking at that very moment.</p>
<p>"Some one is sleeping there," I said, and then remembered that
all the rooms were locked, and all the keys but mine in Mrs.
Grant's pocket, up at the house.</p>
<p>"Well, let the ghosts enjoy themselves; I won't disturb them
if they let me alone. Some of the ladies thought me brave to dare
to sleep here,<!-- Page 219 -->
and it never will do to own I was scared by a foolish story and
an odd sound."</p>
<p>So down I lay, and said the multiplication table with great
determination for several minutes, trying to turn a deaf ear to
the outside world and check my unruly thoughts.</p>
<p>But it was a failure; and when I found myself saying over and
over "Four times twelve is twenty-four," I gave up affecting
courage, and went in for a good, honest scare.</p>
<p>As a cheerful subject for midnight consideration, I kept
thinking of B. Tucker, in spite of every effort to give it up. In
vain I remembered the fact that the departed gentleman was
"always polite to ladies."</p>
<p>I still was in great fear lest he might think it necessary to
come and apologize in person for "bothering" me.</p>
<p>Presently a clock struck three, and I gave a moan that beat
the ghost's all hollow, so full of deep suffering was I at the
thought of several hours of weary waiting.</p>
<p>I was not sure at what time the daylight would appear, and I
was bitterly sorry for<!-- Page 220 --> not gathering useful
information about sunrise, tides, and such things, instead of
listening to the foolish gossip of Uncle Peter on the
hill-top.</p>
<p>Minute after minute dragged slowly on, and I was just thinking
that I should be obliged to shout "Fire!" as the only means of
relief in my power, when, a stealthy step under the window gave
me a new feeling.</p>

<h3>A GHOST STORY.&mdash;PART III.</h3>
<p>This was a start, not a scare&mdash;for the new visitor was a
human foe, and I had little fear of such, being possessed of good
lungs, strong arms, and a Roman dagger nearly as big as a
carving-knife.</p>
<p>The step that I had just heard broke the spell, and creeping
noiselessly to the window, I peeped out to see a dark figure
coming up the stem of the tall tree close by, hand-over-hand,
like a sailor or a monkey.</p>
<p>"Two can play at that game, my friend; you scare me, and I'll
scare you." And with an actual sense of relief in breaking the
silence, I suddenly flung up the curtain, and leaned out.</p>
<p>I brandished my dagger with what I intended to be an
awe-inspiring screech; but, owing to the flutter of my breath,
the effort ended in a curious mixture of howl and bray.</p>
<p>A most effective sound, nevertheless; for the burglar dropped
to the ground as if he had been shot, and, with one upward glance
at the white figure dimly seen in the starlight, fled as if a
thousand ghosts were at his heels.</p>
<p>"What next?" thought I, wondering whether this eventful night
would ever come to a close.</p>
<p>I sat and waited, chilly but brave, while the strange sounds
went on within the house and silence reigned without, till the
cheerful crow of the punctual "cockadoo," as Margie called him,
told me that it was sunrise and laid the ghosts.</p>
<p>A red glow in the east drove away my last fear, and I soon lay
down and slept quietly, quite worn out.</p>
<p>The sun shining upon my face waked me, and a bell ringing
warned me to hurry. A childish voice calling out, "Betfast is
most weady, Miss Wee," assured me that sweet little spirits
haunted the cottage as well as ghostly ones.</p>
<p>As I left my room to join Margie, who was waiting for me, I
saw two things which caused me to feel that the horrors of the
night were not all unreal.</p>
<p>Just outside the back bed-room door was a damp place, as if
that part of the floor had been newly washed; and when led by
curiosity, I peeped through the keyhole of the haunted chamber,
my eye distinctly saw an open razor lying on a dusty table.</p>
<p>My seeing was limited to that one object, but it was quite
enough. I went up the hill thinking over the terrible secret
hidden in my breast.</p>
<p>I longed to tell some one, but was ashamed; and, when asked
why I was so pale and absent-minded, I answered with a gloomy
smile&mdash;</p>
<p>"It is the clams."</p>
<p>All day I hid my sufferings pretty well, but as night
approached and I thought of sleeping again in that haunted
cottage, my heart began to fail. As we sat telling stories in the
dusk, a bright idea came into my head.</p>
<p>I would relate my ghost story, and rouse the curiosity of my
hearers, so that some of them would offer to stay at the cottage
in hopes of seeing the spirit of the restless Tucker.</p>
<p>Cheered by this fancy, when my turn came I made a thrilling
tale about Bezee Tucker and my night's adventure. After my
hearers were worked up to a proper state of excitement, I paused
for applause.</p>
<p>It came in a most unexpected form, however, for Mrs. Grant
burst out laughing, and the two boys&mdash;Johnny and
Joe&mdash;rolled about in convulsions of merriment.</p>
<p>Much displeased, I demanded the cause of their laughter, and
then joined in the general shout when Mrs. Grant informed me that
Bezee Tucker lived, died in, and haunted the tumble-down house at
the other end of the lane, and not the cottage where I was
staying.</p>
<p>"Then who or what made those mysterious noises?" I asked,
relieved but rather displeased at the downfall of my romance.</p>
<p>"My brother Seth," replied Mrs. Grant, still laughing. "I
thought you might be afraid to be there all alone, so he slipped
into the bed-room, and I forgot to tell you. He's a powerful
snorer, and that's one of the awful sounds.</p>
<p>"The other was the dripping of salt water; for you wanted
some, and the girl got it in a leaky pail. Seth swept out the
water when he left the cottage early in the morning."</p>
<p>I said nothing about having seen through the keyhole the
harmless razor; but wishing to get some praise for my heroic
encounter with the burglar, I mildly asked if it was the custom
in York for men as well as turkeys to roost in trees.</p>
<p>Another burst of laughter from the boys did away with my last
hope of glory. As soon as he could speak, Joe answered&mdash;</p>
<p>"Johnny planned to be up early to pick the last cherries off
that tree. I wanted to get ahead of him, and as I was going
a-fishing, I went off quietly before daylight."</p>
<p>"Did you get the cherries?" I asked, bound to have some laugh
on my side.</p>
<p>"Guess I didn't," grumbled Joe, rubbing his knees, while
Johnny added&mdash;</p>
<p>"He got a horrid scare and a right good scraping, for he
didn't know any one was down there. Couldn't go a-fishing,
either&mdash;he was so lame&mdash;and I had the cherries after
all. Served him right, didn't it?"</p>
<p>No answer was necessary. Mrs. Grant went off to repeat the
tale in the kitchen, and the sounds of hearty laughter that I
heard, assured me that Seth was enjoying the joke as well as the
rest of us.</p>

<h3>THE RHINOCEROS.</h3>
<p>Next to the mighty elephant, the rhinoceros is the largest and
strongest of animals. There are several species of the
rhinoceros, some of which are found in Asia, and others in
different parts of Africa.</p>
<p>In the latter country there are four varieties&mdash;the black
rhinoceros, having a single horn; the black species having two
horns; the long-horned white rhinoceros; and the common white
species, which has a short, stubby horn.</p>
<p>The largest of the African species is the long-horned, white,
or square-nosed rhinoceros. When full-grown, it sometimes
measures eighteen feet in length, and about the same around the
body. Its horn frequently reaches a length of thirty inches.
<!-- Page 229 --></p>
<p>The black rhinoceros, although much, smaller than the white,
and seldom having a horn over eighteen inches long, is far more
ferocious than the white species, and possesses a wonderful
degree of strength.</p>
<p>The form of the rhinoceros is clumsy, and its appearance dull
and heavy. The limbs are thick and powerful, and each, foot has
three toes, which are covered with broad, hoof-like nails.</p>
<p>The tail is small; the head very long and large. Taken
altogether, there are few&mdash;if any&mdash;animals that compare
with the rhinoceros in ugliness.</p>
<p>The eyes are set in such a manner that the animal can not see
any thing exactly in front of it; but the senses of hearing and
smelling are so keen that sight is not required to detect an
enemy, whether it be man or beast.</p>
<p>The skin of the African rhinoceros is smooth, and has only a
few scattering hairs here and there. It is, however, very thick
and tough, and can resist the force of a rifle-ball unless it is
fired from a very short distance.</p>
<p>The largest known species of the rhinoceros is found in Asia.
It lives<!-- Page 230 -->
chiefly in the marshy jungles, and on the banks of lakes and
rivers in India. Some of this species are over live feet in
height, and have horns three feet in length and eighteen inches
around the base.</p>
<p>Unlike the African rhinoceros, the skin of the Asiatic species
is not smooth, but lies in thick folds upon the body, forming
flaps which can be lifted with the hand.</p>
<p>The food of the rhinoceros consists of roots, and the young
branches and leaves of trees and shrubs.</p>
<p>It plows up the roots with the aid of its horn, and gathers
the branches and leaves with the upper lip which is long and
pointed, and with which the food is rolled together before
placing it in the mouth.</p>
<p>The flesh of the rhinoceros is good to eat; and its strong,
thick skin is made by the natives, into shields, whips, and other
articles.</p>
<p>Though clumsy and apparently very stupid, the rhinoceros is a
very active animal when attacked or otherwise alarmed, dashing
about with wonderful rapidity.</p>
<!-- Page 231 -->
<p>It is very fierce and savage&mdash;so much so that the natives
dread it more than they do the lion. In hunting the animal, it is
dangerous for a man to fire at one unless he is mounted upon a
swift horse, and can easily reach some place of safety.</p>
<p>When attacking an enemy, the rhinoceros lowers its head and
rushes forward like an angry goat. Though it may not see the
object of its attack, the sense of smell is so acute that it
knows about when the enemy is reached.</p>
<p>Then begins a furious tossing of the head, and if the powerful
horn strikes the foe, a terrible wound is the result.</p>
<p>When wounded itself, the rhinoceros loses all sense of fear,
and charges again and again with such desperate fury that the
enemy is almost always overcome.</p>
<p>A famous traveler in South Africa relates the following
incident that happened during one of his hunting excursions:</p>
<p>"Having proceeded about two miles, I came upon a black
rhinoceros, feeding on some Wait-a-bit thorns within fifty yards
of me.</p>
<p>"I fired from the saddle, and sent a bullet<!-- Page 232 --> in
behind his shoulder, when he rushed forward, blowing like a
grampus, and then stood looking about him.</p>
<p>"Presently he started off, and I followed. I expected that he
would come to bay, but it seems a rhinoceros never does
that&mdash;a fact I did not know at that time.</p>
<p>"Suddenly he fell flat upon the ground; but soon recovering his
feet, he resumed his course as if nothing had happened.</p>
<div class="figright"><img alt="rhinoceros (70K)" src=
"images/233.jpg" height="500" width="431" /></div>
<p>"I spurred on my horse, dashed ahead, and rode right in his
path. Upon this, the hideous monster charged me in the most
resolute manner, blowing loudly through his nostrils.</p>
<p>"Although I quickly turned about, he followed me at such a
furious pace for several hundred yards, with his horrid horny
snout within a few yards of my horse's tail, that I thought my
destruction was certain.</p>
<p>"The animal, however, suddenly turned and ran in another
direction. I had now become so excited with the incident, that I
determined to give him one more shot any way.</p>
<p>"Nerving my horse again, I made another<!-- Page 233 --> dash,
after the rhinoceros, and coming up pretty close to him, I again
fired, though with little effect, the ball striking some thick
portion of his skin and doing no harm.</p>
<p>"Feeling that I did not care to run the chance of the huge
brute again charging<!-- Page 234 --> me, and believing that my
rifle-ball was not powerful enough to kill him, I determined to
give up the pursuit, and accordingly let him run off while I
returned to the camp."</p>

<h3>PRESENCE OF MIND.</h3>
<p>Many years ago, there lived on the banks of the Naugatuck
River, in Connecticut, a family by the name of Bishop.
<!-- Page 235 --></p>
<p>The father was not wealthy, but a good man, and respected by
all who knew him. He had fought in the battles of his country
during the Revolutionary War, and was familiar with scenes of
danger and peril.</p>
<p>He had learned that it is always more prudent to preserve an
air of confidence in danger, than to show signs of fear, and
especially so, since his conduct might have a great influence
upon the minds of those about him.</p>
<p>On one occasion he sent his son James, a boy twelve years old,
across the river to the house of a relative, on an errand. As
there was no bridge or ferry, all who crossed the river were
obliged to ford it.</p>
<p>James was familiar with every part of the fording-place, and
when the water was low, which was the case at this time, there
was no danger in crossing.</p>
<p>Mounted on one of his father's best horses, James set out. He
crossed the river, and soon reached the house of his
relatives.</p>
<p>He was ready to start on his return, when suddenly the heavens
became black with clouds, the wind blew with great violence, and
the rain fell in torrents.</p>
<p>It was late in the afternoon, and as his relatives feared
<!-- Page
236 --> to have him attempt to reach home in such a storm, they
persuaded him to remain over night and wait until daylight before
starting for home.</p>
<p>His father suspected the cause of James' delay, and was not
over anxious on his account. He knew that the boy was prudent,
and did not fear that any accident would happen to him during the
night.</p>
<p>But he knew that he had taught James to obey his commands in
every particular, and as the boy possessed, a daring and fearless
spirit, that he would attempt to ford the river as soon as it was
light enough in the morning.</p>
<p>He knew, also, that the immense quantity of water that
appeared to be falling, would cause the river to rise to a
considerable height by morning, and make it very dangerous even
for a strong man to attempt to cross it.</p>
<p>The thought of what might befall his child caused Mr. Bishop
to pass a sleepless night; for although he was very strict with
his children, he possessed an affectionate nature and loved them
dearly.</p>
<p>The day dawned;<!-- Page 237 --> the storm had ceased; the
wind was still, and nothing was to be heard but the roar of the
river.</p>
<p>The rise of the river was even greater than Mr. Bishop
expected, and as soon as it was light enough, for him to see
objects across it, he took up a position on the bank to watch for
the approach of his son.</p>
<p>James arrived on the opposite shore at the same time, and his
horse was beginning to enter the stream.</p>
<p>All his father's feelings were roused into action, for he knew
that his son was in fearful danger. James had already proceeded
too far to return&mdash;in fact, to go forward or back was
equally dangerous.</p>
<p>His horse had arrived at the deepest part of the river, and
was struggling against the current. The animal was being hurried
down the stream, and apparently making but little progress toward
the shore.</p>
<p>James became very much alarmed. Raising his eyes toward the
landing-place, he discovered his father. Almost frantic with
fear, he exclaimed, "O father, father! I shall drown! I shall
drown!"</p>
<p>"No," replied his father, in a stern and
<!-- Page 238 -->resolute tone of voice, dismissing for a moment
his feelings of tenderness; "if you do, I will whip you severely.
Cling to your horse! Cling to your horse!"</p>
<p>The son, who feared his father more than he did the raging
river, obeyed the command; and the noble animal on which he was
mounted, struggling for some time, carried him safe to shore.</p>
<p>"My son!" exclaimed the glad father, bursting into tears,
"remember, hereafter, that in danger you must possess courage,
and being determined to save your life, cling to the last
hope!</p>
<p>"If I had replied to you with the tenderness and fear which I
felt, you might have lost your life; you would have lost your
presence of mind, been carried away by the current, and I should
have seen you no more."</p>
<p>What a noble example is this! The heroism of this father and
his presence of mind saved the life of his boy.</p>

<h3>HALBERT AND HIS DOG.</h3>
<p>Far up in the Highlands of Scotland lived Malcolm, a shepherd,
with his wife and his son Halbert.</p>
<p>Their little cottage was far from any village, and could only
be reached by a rugged path through the mountains.</p>
<p>One evening Halbert's mother was taken very ill, and Malcolm
made preparations to go to the village to obtain some medicine
for her.</p>
<p>"Father," said Halbert, "I know the path through the dark glen
better than you. Shag will walk before me, and I will be quite
safe. Let me go for the doctor, and you stay at home and comfort
mother."</p>
<p>Old Shag, the dog, stood by, wagging his tail and looking up
into Malcolm's face as <!-- Page 240 -->if to say, "Yes, master,
I will take good care of Halbert. Let him go."</p>
<p>Malcolm did not like to have his boy undertake a journey of so
much peril, as the snow was falling in heavy flakes, and it was
growing very dark. But the boy again repeated his request, and
Malcolm gave his consent.</p>
<p>Halbert had been accustomed to the mountains from his earliest
boyhood, and Shag set out with his young master, not seeming to
care for wind, snow, or storm.</p>
<p>They reached the village safely. Halbert saw the doctor,
received some medicine for his mother, and then started on his
return home with a cheerful heart.</p>
<p>Shag trotted along before him to see that all was right.
Suddenly, however, in one of the most dangerous parts of the
rocky path, he stopped and began snuffing and smelling about.</p>
<p>"Go on, Shag," said Halbert.</p>
<p>Shag would not stir.</p>
<p>"Shag, go on, sir," repeated the boy. "We are nearly at the
top of the glen. Look through the dark, and you can see the
candle shining through our window."</p>
<!-- Page 241 -->
<p>Shag disobeyed for the first time in his life, and Halbert
advanced ahead of him, heedless of the warning growl of his
companion.</p>
<p>He had proceeded but a few steps when he fell over a
precipice, the approach to which had been concealed by the
snow.</p>
<p>It was getting late in the night, and Malcolm began to be
alarmed at the long absence of Halbert. He placed the candle so
as to throw the light over his boy's path, piled wood on the
great hearth fire, and often went to the door.</p>
<p>But no footstep sounded on the crackling ice; no figure
darkened the wide waste of snow.</p>
<p>"Perhaps the doctor is not at home, and he is waiting for
him," said Halbert's mother. She felt so uneasy at her boy's
absence, that she almost forgot her own pain.</p>
<p>It was midnight when Malcolm heard the well-known bark of the
faithful Shag.</p>
<p>"O there is Halbert!" cried both parents at the same moment.
Malcolm sprang to the door and opened it, expecting to see his
son.</p>
<p><!-- Page 242 -->But alas! Halbert was not there. Shag was
alone. The old dog entered the door, and began to whine in a
piteous manner.</p>
<p>"O Malcolm, Malcolm, my brave son has perished in the snow!"
exclaimed the mother.</p>
<p>Malcolm stood wondering. His heart beat rapidly. A fear that
the worst had happened almost overcame him. At that moment he saw
a small package around the dog's neck.</p>
<p>Seizing it in his hands, he exclaimed, "No, wife; look! Our
boy lives! Here is the medicine, tied with his handkerchief; he
has fallen into one of the deep ravines, but he is safe.</p>
<p>"I will go out, and Shag shall go with me. He will conduct me
safely to the rescue of my child."</p>
<p>In an instant Shag was again on his feet, and gave evidence of
great joy as he left the cottage with his old master.</p>
<p>You may imagine the misery and grief the poor mother
suffered&mdash;alone in her mountain dwelling; the certainty of
her son's danger, and the fear that her husband also might
perish.</p>
<p><!-- Page 243 -->Shag went on straight and steadily for some
distance after he left the cottage. Suddenly he turned down a
path which led to the foot of the precipice over which Halbert
had fallen.</p>
<p>The descent was steep and dangerous, and Malcolm was
frequently obliged to support himself by clinging to the frozen
branches of the trees.</p>
<p>At last Malcolm stood on the lower and opposite edge of the
pit into which his son had fallen. He called to him, "Halbert!
Halbert!" He looked in every direction, but could not see or hear
any thing.</p>
<p>Shag was making his way down a very steep and dangerous ledge
of rocks, and Malcolm resolved at all hazards to follow him.</p>
<p>After getting to the bottom, Shag scrambled to a projecting
rock, which was covered with snow, and commenced whining and
scratching in a violent manner.</p>
<p>Malcolm followed, and after some search found what appeared to
be the dead body of his son. He hastily tore off the jacket,
which was soaked with blood and snow, and wrapping Halbert in his
great cloak, <!-- Page 244 -->took him upon his shoulders, and
with much toil and difficulty reached the path again, and soon
had his boy at home.</p>
<p>Halbert was placed in his mother's bed, and by using great
exertion, they aroused him from his dangerous sleep.</p>
<p>He was much bruised and had his ankle dislocated, but was not
otherwise hurt. When he recovered his senses, he fixed his eyes
on his mother, and his first words were, "Did you get the
medicine, mother?"</p>
<p>When he fell, Shag had descended after him. The affectionate
son used what little strength he had left to tie the medicine
that he had received from the doctor around the dog's neck, and
then sent him home with it.</p>
<p>You may be sure that Shag was well taken care of after this
incident. Even after Halbert became a man Shag was his constant
companion, and he lived to a good old age.</p>

<p>The tide comes up, and the tide goes down,</p>
<p>Over the rocks, so rugged and brown,</p>
<p>And the cruel sea, with a hungry roar,</p>
<p>Dashes its breakers along the shore;</p>
<p>But steady and clear, with a constant ray,</p>
<p>The star of the light-house shines alway.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>The ships come sailing across the main,</p>

<p>And the blinding fog comes down at night,</p>
<p>Shrouding and hiding the harbor light.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>The sailors, sailing their ships along,</p>
<p>Will tell you a tale of the light-house strong;</p>

<h3>THE CATERPILLAR AND BUTTERFLY.</h3>
<p>Last summer, when the trees were covered with green leaves,
and when the little stream was sparkling and dancing in the sun,
there appeared in the garden, a large caterpillar of many colors,
and about as pretty as a caterpillar could be.</p>
<p>All day long it was nibbling the green leaves, and leaf after
leaf disappeared before it with wonderful rapidity. It seemed to
live only for eating.</p>
<p>As autumn came on, it quite lost its appetite; so much so,
that even the tenderest and most juicy leaves could not tempt it
to eat any more. It grew dull and stiff, and lost all interest in
life.</p>
<p>Feeling that some change was about to happen, it crawled into
a little hole in the old garden wall. It wrapped itself up in a
cobweb, and fell into a long sleep, during which it became
changed from a caterpillar into a dried-up, dead-looking grub or
chrysalis.</p>
<p>It remained in this state through all the long winter, till
the snow and frost had gone, and the cold March winds were
over.</p>
<p>In April the trees burst forth with their bright green leaves,
and the grass looked fresh under the power of the warm rains.</p>
<p>In May the many-tinted flowers appeared, filling the air with
their sweetness, and brightening the fields and gardens with
their gay colors.</p>
<p>At this time another great change came over the old grub. It
showed signs of life again; but it was now no longer a
caterpillar&mdash;it was something else.</p>
<p>It wriggled and turned in its narrow little home, and seemed
anxious to get out and look at the sunshine and flowers. It
bumped its head up and down until it succeeded in pushing off a
little door.</p>
<p>When the door was off, and the bright sunlight shone in, this
little occupant of the chrysalis took a look at itself.</p>
<p>It saw that during its long winter's nap, it had acquired a
pair of beautiful wings, and its legs had grown longer and
stronger than they were before.</p>
<p>Crawling out of the chrysalis, and taking a position on a
branch of the tree, it discovered that instead of a caterpillar,
it was now a beautiful butterfly.</p>
<p>It was a kind that is called the swallow-tail butterfly,
because each of its wings tapered to a point, something like the
tail of a swallow. We will call the butterfly, Miss Swallow-tail,
and now let us see what her next move was.</p>
<p>Her wings were damp and heavy, and she stood shivering and
trembling; for although she had six legs, they were weak, having
never before borne such a weight.</p>
<p>But fresh air brings strength; so she soon felt like trying to
walk. At first her movements were sluggish, but she finally
reached a sunny spot where she dried and warmed herself, giving
her wings a little shake now and then, until they opened grandly
above her back.</p>
<p>And how beautiful they were! Dark brown, bordered with two
rows of yellow spots; and there were seven blue spots on each of
the hind wings.</p>
<p>As she stood there in the sun, a little wind came along and
raised Miss Swallow-tail off her feet. She spread her wings to
keep from falling, and found herself floating in the air.</p>
<p>This proved to be such a delightful way of traveling, that she
lifted her wings occasionally, and so kept herself floating; and
in a short time she learned to turn in any direction she
chose.</p>
<p>As she flew along, growing stronger every minute, she was
attracted by the bright colors of a flower, and stopped to admire
it.</p>
<p>The sweet perfume tempted her to taste, and unrolling her long
tongue from under her chin, where she carried it, she put it down
into the flower and drew up the honey hidden there.</p>
<p>Miss Swallow-tail had wonderful eyes. All butterflies have
wonderful eyes. If you will look at them through a microscope you
will find that each eye is composed of a great many smaller ones,
that can see in all directions.</p>
<p>They have great need of such eyes, because there are so many
birds and other hungry creatures, that want to eat them.</p>
<p>One day a whiff of celery coming from a garden near by,
reminded Miss Swallow-tail of the time when she was a baby and
liked to eat celery.</p>
<p>So she flew over into the garden, and fastened her eggs to a
celery bush with some glue that she carried with her. Then she
left them, and never thought of them again.</p>
<p>In about ten days the babies that had been growing inside of
the eggs, broke open the shells and crawled out. And what do you
think they were? Butterflies? like their mamma, only very much
smaller?</p>
<p>No, indeed! for you know butterflies never grow any larger.
They were the smallest green and black worms you ever saw!</p>
<p>As soon as they were out of the shells, they began eating the
celery, and grew so fast that in a week they were quite large
worms.</p>
<p>They were covered with green rings and black rings dotted with
yellow. They each had sixteen short legs, and they had a
flesh-colored, Y-shaped horn hidden away under a ring above the
head, that they would show when they were disturbed.</p>
<p>One morning the gardener discovered that something was eating
his celery. Searching among the leaves he found all but one of
the little worms, and put them where they could do no more
mischief.</p>
<p>Soon the little worm that had escaped his notice, had grown so
fat that he was too stupid to eat any more; so he crawled away to
a dark place on the fence and fastened himself there.</p>
<p>But first he covered a small spot of the fence with a white,
silken carpet, that he wove from a web which he drew from his
under lip.</p>
<p>He then glued the end of a web to the carpet, carried the rest
of it up over his breast, and down on the other side and fastened
it there.</p>
<p>He then bent his head down under it, letting it pass over his
head, and by bending forward and backward worked it down near the
middle of his back. After inspecting his work, he bent his head
upon his breast, and leaned against the fence.</p>
<p>After resting two days, he began a series of twistings and
turnings that burst open his skin from the corners of his mouth
down a short way, and worked it all off himself.</p>
<p>He drew his head in out of sight, and sent out a stubbed horn
on each side of it, and lo! no worm was to be seen!&mdash;but a
chrysalis, like the one his mother was sleeping in when we first
found her.</p>

<h3>WILD HORSES OF SOUTH AMERICA.</h3>
<p>At the time of the discovery of America there were no wild
horses in any part of the continent.</p>
<p>Soon, however, some of the horses brought over from Europe by
the early settlers, wandered away, and now wild horses are to be
met with in large numbers, in some cases as many as a thousand at
a time.</p>
<p>They appear to be under the command of a leader, the strongest
and boldest of the herd, whom they obey.</p>
<p>When threatened with danger, at some signal, understood by
them all, they either close together and trample their enemy to
death, or form themselves into a circle and welcome him with
their heels.</p>
<p>The leader first faces the danger, and when he finds it
prudent to retreat, all follow his rapid flight.</p>
<p>Byron thus describes a troop of wild horses:</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>"A trampling troop; I see them come!</p>
<p>In one vast squadron they advance!</p>
<p>I strove to cry&mdash;my lips were dumb.</p>
<p>The steeds rush on in plunging pride;</p>
<p>But where are they the reins to guide?</p>
<p>A thousand horse&mdash;and none to ride!</p>
<p>With flowing tail, and flying mane,</p>
<p>Wide nostrils&mdash;never stretch'd by pain,</p>
<p>Mouths bloodless to the bit or rein</p>
<p>And feet that iron never shod,</p>
<p>And flanks unscarr'd by spur or rod,</p>
<p>A thousand horse, the wild, the free,</p>
<p>Like waves that follow o'er the sea.</p>
<p>On came the troop....</p>
<p>They stop&mdash;they start&mdash;they snuff the air,</p>
<p>Gallop a moment here and there,</p>
<p>Approach, retire, wheel round and round,</p>
<p>Then plunging back with sudden bound,</p>
<p>They snort&mdash;they foam&mdash;neigh&mdash;swerve aside,</p>
<p>And backward to the forest fly."</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>The capture and breaking in of wild horses in America are
described by Miers as follows&mdash;</p>
<p>"The lasso is used by the natives of South America. It is a
very strong braided thong, half an inch thick, and forty feet
long, made of many strips of rawhide, braided like a whip-thong,
and made soft and pliable by rubbing with grease.</p>
<p>"It has at one end an iron ring, about an inch and a half in
diameter, through which the thong is passed, forming a running
noose.</p>
<p>"The herdsmen&mdash;gauchos, as they are called&mdash;are
generally mounted on horseback when they use the lasso. One end
of the thong is attached to the saddle; the remainder is coiled
in the left hand, except about twelve feet belonging to the noose
end, which is held in a coil in the right hand.</p>
<p>"This long noose is then swung around the head, the weight of
the iron ring at the end of the noose assisting in giving to it,
by a continued circular motion, a sufficient force to project it
the whole length of the line.</p>
<p>"The gauchos drive the wild horses into a corral, which is a
circular space surrounded by rough posts firmly driven into the
ground. The corral," relates Miers, "was quite full of horses,
most of which were young ones about two or three years old.</p>
<p>"The chief gaucho, mounted on a strong, steady horse, rode into
the corral, and threw his lasso over the neck of a young horse
and dragged him to the gate.</p>
<p>"For some time he was very unwilling to lose his companions;
but the moment he was forced out of the corral his first idea was
to gallop away; however, a timely jerk of the lasso checked
him.</p>
<p>"Some of the gauchos now ran after him on foot, and threw a
lasso over his fore legs, and jerking it, they pulled his legs
from under him so suddenly that I really thought the fall had
killed him.</p>
<p>"In an instant a gaucho was seated on his head. They then put a
piece of hide in his mouth to serve for a bit, and a strong hide
halter on his head, and allowed him to get on his feet.</p>
<p>"While two men held the horse by his ears, the gaucho who was
to mount him fastened on the saddle, and then quickly sprung into
it.</p>
<p>"The horse instantly began to jump in a manner which made it
very difficult for the rider to keep his seat; however, the
gaucho's spurs soon set him going, and off he galloped, doing
every thing in his power to throw his rider.</p>
<p>"Then another horse was brought from the corral; and so quickly
was every thing done that twelve gauchos were mounted in less
than an hour.</p>
<div class="figright"><img alt="lassoed horse (95K)" src=
"images/260.jpg" height="500" width="453" /></div>
<p>"It was wonderful to see the different manner in which
different horses behaved. Some would actually scream while the
gauchos were fastening the saddle upon their backs, and some
would instantly lie down and roll upon it.</p>
<p>"Others would stand without being held, their legs stiff and in
unnatural positions, their necks half bent towards their tails,
and looking vicious and obstinate.</p>
<p>"It was now curious to look around and see the gauchos trying
to bring their horses back to the corral, which is the most
difficult part of their work, for the poor creatures had been so
scared there that they were unwilling to return to the place.</p>
<p>"At last they brought the horses back, apparently subdued and
broken in. The saddles and bridles were taken off, and the young
horses trotted off towards the corral, neighing to one
another.</p>
<p>"When a gaucho wishes to take a wild horse, he mounts a horse
that has been used to the sport, and gallops over the plain.</p>
<p>"As soon as he comes near his victim, the lasso is thrown round
the two hind-legs, and as the gaucho rides a little on one side,
the jerk throws the wild horse without doing injury to his knees
or his face.</p>

<p>"Before the horse can recover from the shock, the rider
dismounts, and snatching his cloak from his shoulders, wraps it
round the fallen animal's head.</p>
<p>"He then forces into his mouth one of the powerful bridles of
the country, fastens a saddle on his back, and, mounting him,
removes the cloak.</p>
<p>"Upon this the astonished horse springs to his feet, and
attempts to throw off his new master, who sits calmly on his
back.</p>
<p>"By a treatment which never fails, the gaucho brings the horse
to such complete obedience that he is soon trained to give his
whole speed and strength to the capture of his companions."</p>

<h3>AN EMPEROR'S KINDNESS.</h3>
<p>Joseph II., Emperor of Austria, was a generous, warm-hearted
man, who took great delight in doing acts of kindness and
charity.</p>
<p>One time, as he was passing through the streets of Vienna,
dressed as a private gentleman, his attention was attracted to a
boy about twelve years old, who timidly approached, and seemed,
anxious to speak to him.</p>
<p>"What do you wish, my little friend?" said the gentleman. His
voice was so tender, and he had such a kindly look in his eyes,
that the boy had courage to say:</p>
<p>"O sir, you are very good to speak to me so kindly. I believe
you will not refuse to do something for me."</p>
<p>"I should be sorry to refuse you," replied the gentleman; "but
why are you begging? You appear to be something better than a
beggar; your voice and your manner show it."</p>
<p>"I am not a beggar, sir," replied the boy, as a tear trickled
down his cheek. "My father was a brave officer in the army. Owing
to illness, he was obliged to leave the service, and was granted
a pension by the emperor.</p>
<p>"With this pension he supported our family; but a few months
ago he died, and we are left very poor indeed."</p>
<p>"Poor child!" said the gentleman. "Is your mother living?"</p>
<p>"Yes, sir, she is; and I have two brothers who are at home
with her now. She has been unable to leave her bed for weeks, and
one of us must watch beside her, while the others go out to
beg."</p>
<p>Saying this, the poor boy tried very hard to keep back the
great tears, but they would come in spite of all he could do to
stop them.</p>
<p>"Well, well, my boy," said the gentleman, "do not feel so
unhappy; I will see what can be done to help you. Is there a
physician to be found near you?"</p>
<p>"There are two, sir, only a little way from where we
live."</p>
<p>"That is well. Now you go at once and have one of them visit
your mother. Here is money, not only for the physician, but for
other things to feed you and make you comfortable."</p>
<p>"O sir," said the boy, as he looked upon the gentleman in
amazement, "how can I thank you enough? This money will save my
mother's life, and keep my brothers from want."</p>
<p>"Never mind, my child; go and get the physician."</p>
<p>The boy obeyed, and the good emperor having learned the
situation of the house where the boy's mother lived, bent his
steps in that direction, and soon arrived there.</p>
<p>The room in which he found the poor woman gave evidence of
great misery.</p>
<p>She was lying on a low bedstead, and though still young, her
face was pale and thin from sickness and want. Very little
furniture of any kind was to be seen, for the mother had disposed
of nearly all she possessed to obtain bread for her children.</p>
<p>When the emperor entered the room, the widow and her children
looked at him in astonishment. They did not know he was their
emperor.</p>
<p>"I am a physician, madam," said he, bowing respectfully; "your
neighbors have informed me of your illness, and I am come to
offer what service may be in my power."</p>
<p>"Alas! sir," she answered with some hesitation, "I have no
means of paying you for your attention."</p>
<p>"Do not distress yourself on that account; I shall be fully
repaid if I have the happiness of restoring you to health."</p>
<p>With these words, the emperor approached the bed and inquired
all about her illness, after which he wrote a few lines and
placed them on the chimney-piece.</p>
<p>"I will leave you this prescription, madam; and on my next
visit, I hope to find you much better." He then withdrew. Almost
immediately after this, the eldest son of the widow came in with
a medical man.</p>
<p>"O mother!" cried the boy, "a kind, good gentleman has given
me all this!" and he placed in his mother's hand, the money which
the emperor had given him. "There now, don't cry, mother; this
money will pay the doctor and buy every thing till you are well
and strong again."</p>
<p>"A physician has already been here, my child, and has left his
prescription. See, there it is." and she pointed to the paper on
the chimney-piece. The boy took the paper, and no sooner had he
glanced at its contents, than he uttered an exclamation of joyful
surprise.</p>
<p>"O mother! It's the best prescription a physician ever wrote;
it's an order for a pension, mother&mdash;a pension for
you&mdash;signed by the emperor himself; listen, mother; hear
what he says:&mdash;</p>
<div class="blockquot">
<p>"'<i>Madam:</i>&mdash;Your son was fortunate enough to meet me
in the city, and informed me of the fact that the widow of one of
my bravest officers was suffering from poverty and sickness,
without any means of assistance. I had no knowledge of this,
therefore I can not be accused of injustice.</p>
<p>"'It is difficult for me to know every thing that takes place in
my empire. Now that I do know of your distress, I should indeed
be ungrateful, did I not render you all the help in my power. I
shall immediately place your name on the pension list for the
yearly sum of two thousand florins, and trust that you may live
many years to enjoy it.</p>
<p class="author">"'<i>Joseph II</i>.'"</p>
</div>
<p>The widow and her children were taken under the especial care
of the emperor, and a brilliant career was opened up for the
boys, who had inherited all their father's bravery as well as
their mother's gentle nature.</p>

<h3>A STORY OF THE SIOUX WAR.&mdash;PART I.</h3>
<p>In the summer of 1862, while we were living in the State of
Minnesota, I had an experience which I regard as one of the most
remarkable that I ever met with.</p>
<p>We lived at Lac Qui Parle, or rather quite close to it, for we
were about a mile from the place.</p>
<p>There were only three of us&mdash;father, mother, and myself.
We had moved to Minnesota three years before, the main object of
my parents being to restore their health; for they were feeble
and needed a change of climate.</p>
<p>The first year, both father and mother were much benefited;
but not long after, father began to fail.</p>
<p>I remember that he used to take his chair out in front of the
house in pleasant weather and sit there, with his eyes turned
toward the blue horizon, or into the depths of the vast
wilderness which was not more than a stone's throw from our
door.</p>
<p>Mother would sometimes go out and sit beside father, and they
would talk long and earnestly in low tones. I was too young to
understand all this at the time, but it was not long afterward
that I learned the truth.</p>
<p>Father was steadily and surely declining in health; but mother
had become strong and robust, and her disease seemed to have left
her altogether. She tried to encourage father, and really
believed his weakness was only temporary.</p>
<p>Scarcely a day passed that I did not see some of the Sioux
Indians who were scattered through that portion of the State. In
going to, and coming from the agency, they would sometimes stop
at our house.</p>
<p>Father was very quick in picking up languages, and he was able
to converse quite easily with the red men.</p>
<p>How I used to laugh to hear them talk in their odd language,
which sounded to me just as if they were grunting at each
other.</p>
<p>But the visits used to please father and mother, and I was
always glad to see some of the rather ragged and not over-clean
warriors stop at the house.</p>
<p>I remember one hot day in June, when father was sitting under
a tree in front of the house, and I was inside helping mother, we
heard the peculiar noises which told us that father had an Indian
visitor. We both went to the door, and I passed outside to laugh
at their queer talk.</p>
<p>Sure enough, an Indian was seated in the other chair, and he
and father were talking with great animation.</p>
<p>The Indian was of a stout build, and wore a straw hat with a
broad, red band around it; he had on a fine, black broad-cloth
coat, but his trousers were shabby and his shoes were pretty well
worn.</p>
<p>His face was bright and intelligent, and I watched it very
closely as he talked in his earnest way with father, who was
equally animated in answering him.</p>
<p>The Indian carried a rifle and a revolver&mdash;the latter
being in plain sight at his waist&mdash;but I never connected the
thought of danger with him as he sat there talking with
father.</p>
<p>I describe this Indian rather closely, as he was no other than
the well-known chief, Little Crow, who was at the head of the
frightful Sioux war, which broke out within sixty days from that
time.</p>
<p>The famous chieftain staid until the sun went down. Then he
started up and walked away rapidly in the direction of Lac Qui
Parle. Father called good-by to him, but he did not reply and
soon disappeared in the woods.</p>
<p>The sky was cloudy, and it looked as if a storm was coming;
so, as it was dark and blustering, we remained within doors the
rest of the evening. A fine drizzling rain began to fall, and the
darkness was intense.</p>
<p>The evening was well advanced, and father was reading to us,
when there came a rap upon the door.</p>
<p>It was so gentle and timid that it sounded like the pecking of
a bird, and we all looked in the direction of the door, uncertain
what it meant.</p>
<p>"It is a bird, scared by the storm," said father, "and we may
as well admit it."</p>
<p>I sat much nearer the door than either of my parents, and
instantly started up and opened it. As I did so, I looked out
into the gloom, but sprung back the next moment with a low cry of
alarm.</p>
<p>"What's the matter?" asked father, hastily laying down his
book and walking rapidly toward me.</p>
<p>"It isn't a bird; it's a person." As I spoke, a little Indian
girl, about my own age, walked into the room, and looking in each
of our faces, asked in the Sioux language whether she could stay
all night.</p>
<p>I closed the door and we gathered around her. She had the
prettiest, daintiest moccasins, but her limbs were bare from the
knee downward. She wore a large shawl about her shoulders, while
her coarse, black hair hung loosely below her waist.</p>
<p>Her face was very pretty, and her eyes were as black as coal
and seemed to flash fire whenever she looked upon any one.</p>
<p>Of course, her clothing was dripping with moisture, and her
call filled us all with wonder. She could speak only a few words
of English, so her face lighted up with pleasure when father
addressed her in the Sioux language.</p>
<p>As near as we could find out, her name was Chitto, and she
lived with her parents at Lac Qui Parle. She told us that there
were several families in a spot by themselves, and that day they
had secured a quantity of strong drink, of which they were
partaking very freely.</p>
<p>At such times Indians are dangerous, and Little Chitto was
terrified almost out of her senses. She fled through the storm
and the darkness, not caring where she went, but only anxious to
get away from the dreadful scene.</p>
<p>Entering, without any intention on her part, the path in the
woods, she followed it until she saw in the distance the glimmer
of the light in our window, when she hastened to the house and
asked for admission.</p>
<p>I need scarcely say it was gladly granted. My mother removed
the damp clothes from the little Sioux girl, and replaced them
with some warm, dry ones belonging to me. At the same time she
gave her hot, refreshing tea, and did every thing to make her
comfortable.</p>
<p>I removed the little moccasins from the wondering Chitto's
feet, kissed her dark cheeks, and, as I uttered expressions of
pity, though in an unknown tongue, I am quite sure that they were
understood by Chitto, who looked the gratitude she could not
express.</p>
<p>She soon began to show signs of drowsiness and was put to bed
with me, falling asleep as soon as her head touched the
pillow.</p>
<p>I lay awake a little longer and noticed that the storm had
ceased. The patter of the rain was heard no more upon the roof,
and the wind blew just as it sometimes does late in the fall. At
last I sunk into a sound sleep.</p>

<h3>A STORY OF THE SIOUX WAR.&mdash;PART II.</h3>
<p>I awoke in the morning and saw the rays of the sun entering
the window. Recalling the incidents of the previous evening, I
turned to speak to my young friend.</p>
<p>To my surprise she was gone, and supposing she had risen a
short time before, I hurriedly dressed myself and went down
stairs to help keep her company.</p>
<p>But she was not there, and father and mother had seen nothing
of her. She had no doubt risen in the night and gone quietly
away.</p>
<p>There was something curious and touching in the fact that she
had groped about in the darkness, until she found her own
clothing, which she put on and departed without taking so much as
a pin that belonged to us.</p>
<p>We all felt a strong interest in Chitto, and father took me
with him a few days later when he visited Lac Qui Parle. He made
many inquiries for the little girl, but could learn nothing about
her.</p>
<p>I felt very much disappointed, for I had built up strong hopes
of taking her out home with me to spend several days.</p>
<p>Father and I went a number of times afterward, and always made
an effort to discover Chitto; but we did not gain any knowledge
of her.</p>
<p>On the afternoon of August 19, father was sitting in his
accustomed seat in front of the house, and mother was engaged, as
usual about her household duties. I was playing and amusing
myself as a girl of my age is inclined to do at all times.</p>
<p>The day was sultry and close, and I remember that father was
unusually pale and weak. He coughed a great deal, and sat for a
long time so still that I thought he must be asleep.</p>
<p>"Mother," said I, "what is that smoke yonder?"</p>
<p>I pointed in the direction of Lac Qui Parle. She saw a dark
column of smoke floating off in the horizon, its location being
such, that there could be no doubt that it was at the Agency.</p>
<p>"There is a fire of some kind there," she said, while she
shaded her eyes with her hand and gazed long and earnestly in
that direction.</p>
<p>"The Indians are coming, Edward," she called to father; "they
will be here in a few minutes!"</p>
<p>Suddenly, a splendid black horse came galloping from the
woods, and with two or three powerful bounds, halted directly in
front of me. As it did so, I saw that the bareback rider was a
small girl, and she was our little Sioux friend, Chitto.</p>
<p>She made a striking picture, with her long, black hair
streaming over her shoulders, and her dress fluttering in the
wind.</p>
<p>"Why, Chitto," said I, in amazement, "where did you come
from?"</p>
<p>"Must go&mdash;must go&mdash;must go!" she exclaimed, in great
excitement. "Indian soon be here!"</p>
<p>So it seemed that, in the few weeks since she had been at our
house, she had picked up enough of the English language to make
herself understood.</p>
<p>"What do you mean?" asked mother, as she and I advanced to the
side of the black steed upon which the little Sioux sat; "what
are the Indians doing?"</p>
<p>"They burn buildings&mdash;have killed people&mdash;coming
this way!"</p>
<p>Chitto spoke the truth, for the Sioux were raging like demons
at that very hour at Lac Qui Parle.</p>
<p>"What shall we do, Chitto?" asked my mother.</p>
<p>"Get on horse&mdash;he carry you."</p>
<p>"But my husband; the horse can not carry all three of us."</p>
<p>My poor distracted mother scarcely knew what to do. All this
time father sat like a statue in his chair. A terrible suspicion
suddenly entered her mind, and she ran to him.</p>
<p>Placing her hand upon his shoulder, she addressed him in a low
tone, and then uttered a fearful shriek, as she staggered
backward, saying: "He is dead! he is dead!"</p>
<p>Such was the fact. The shock of the news brought by the little
Indian girl was too much, and he had expired in his chair without
a struggle. The wild cry which escaped my mother was answered by
several whoops from the woods, and Chitto became frantic with
terror.</p>
<p>"Indian be here in minute!" said she.</p>
<p>Mother instantly helped me upon the back of the horse and then
followed herself. She was a skillful rider, but she allowed
Chitto to retain the bridle, and we started off.</p>
<p>Looking back I saw a half-dozen Sioux horsemen come out of the
woods and start on a trot toward us.</p>
<p>Just then Chitto spoke to the horse, and he bounded off at a
terrible rate, never halting until he had gone two or three
miles.</p>
<p>Then, when we looked back, we saw nothing of the Indians, and
the horse was brought down to a walk; and finally, when the sun
went down, we entered a dense wood, where we staid all night.</p>
<p>I shall not attempt to describe those fearful hours. Not one
of us slept a wink. Mother sat weeping over the loss of father,
while I was heart-broken, too.</p>
<p>Chitto, like the Indian she was, kept on the move continually.
Here and there she stole as noiselessly through the wood as a
shadow, while playing the part of sentinel.</p>
<p>At daylight we all fell into a feverish slumber, which lasted
several hours. When we awoke, we were hungry and miserable.</p>
<p>Seeing a settler's house in the distance, Chitto offered to go
to it for food. We were afraid she would get into trouble, but
she was sure there was no danger and went.</p>
<p>In less than an hour she was back again with an abundance of
bread. She said there was no one in the house, and we supposed
the people had become alarmed and escaped.</p>
<p>We staid where we were for three days, during which time we
saw a party of Sioux warriors burn the house where Chitto had
obtained the food for us.</p>
<p>It seemed to mother that the Indians would not remain at Lac
Qui Parle long, and that we would be likely to find safety there.
Accordingly, she induced Chitto to start on the return.</p>
<p>When we reached our house nothing was to be seen of father's
body; but we soon, discovered a newly-made grave, where we had
reason to believe he was buried.</p>
<p>As was afterward ascertained, he had been given a decent
burial by orders of Little Crow himself, who, doubtless, would
have protected us, had we awaited his coming.</p>
<p>We rode carefully through the woods, and when we came out on
the other side, our hearts were made glad by the sight of the
white tents of United States soldiers. Colonel Sibley was
encamped at Lac Qui Parle, and we were safe at last.</p>
<p>Chitto disappeared from this post in the same sudden manner as
before; but I am happy to say that I have seen her several times
since. Mother and I were afraid her people would punish her for
the part she took in helping us, but they did not.</p>
<p>Probably the friendship which Little Crow showed toward our
family, may have had something to do with the gentle treatment
which the Indians showed her.</p>

<h3>VOLCANOES.</h3>
<p>In various parts of the earth, there are mountains that send
out from their highest peaks, smoke, ashes, and fire.</p>
<p>Mountains of this class are called volcanoes, and they present
a striking contrast to other mountains, on account of their
conical form and the character of the rocks of which they are
composed.</p>
<p>All volcanoes have at their summits what are called craters.
These are large, hollow, circular openings, from which the smoke
and fire escape.</p>
<p>Nearly all volcanoes emit smoke constantly. This smoke
proceeds from fires that are burning far down in the depths of
the earth.</p>
<p>Sometimes these fires burst forth from the crater of the
volcano with tremendous force. The smoke becomes thick and black,
and lurid flames shoot up to a height of hundreds of feet, making
a scene of amazing grandeur.</p>

"images/285.jpg" height="500" width="447" /></div>
<p>With the flames there are thrown out stones, ashes, and
streams of melted rock, called lava. This lava flows down the
sides of the mountain, and, being red-hot, destroys every thing
with which it comes in contact. At such times, a volcano is said
to be in eruption.</p>
<p>A volcanic eruption is generally preceded by low, rumbling
sounds, and trembling of the earth's surface. Then follows
greater activity of the volcano, from which dense volumes of
smoke and steam issue, and fire and molten lava make their
appearance.</p>
<p>Such is the force of some of these eruptions, that large rocks
have been hurled to great distances from the crater, and towns
and cities have been buried under a vast covering of ashes and
lava.</p>
<p>The quantity of lava and ashes which sometimes escapes from
volcanoes during an eruption, is almost beyond comprehension.</p>
<p>In 1772, a volcano in the island of Java, threw out ashes and
cinders that covered the ground fifty feet deep, for a distance
of seven miles all around the mountain. This eruption destroyed
nearly forty towns and villages.</p>
<p>In 1783, a volcano in Iceland sent out two streams of lava;
one forty miles long and seven miles wide, and the other fifty
miles long and fifteen miles wide. These streams were from one
hundred to six hundred feet deep.</p>
<p>Near the city of Naples, Italy, is situated the volcano Mt.
Vesuvius. This fiery monster has probably caused more destruction
than any other volcano known.</p>
<p>In the year 79 A.D., it suddenly burst forth in a violent
eruption, that resulted in one of the most appalling disasters
that ever happened.</p>
<p>Such immense quantities of ashes, stones, and lava were poured
forth from its crater, that within the short space of twenty
hours, two large cities were completely destroyed. These cities
were Herculaneum and Pompeii.</p>
<p>At this eruption of Vesuvius, the stream of lava flowed
directly through and over the city of Herculaneum into the sea.
The quantity was so great that, as it cooled and became hardened,
it gradually filled up all the streets and ran over the tops of
the houses.</p>
<p>While the lava was thus turning the city into a mass of solid
stone, the inhabitants were fleeing from it along the shore
toward Naples, and in boats on the sea.</p>
<p>At the same time, too, the wind carried the ashes and cinders
in such a direction as to deluge the city of Pompeii.</p>
<p>Slowly and steadily the immense volume of ashes and small
stones, blocked up the streets and settled on the roofs of
houses.</p>
<p>The light of the flames that burst out from the awful crater,
aided the people in their escape; but many who for some reason
could not get away, perished.</p>
<p>Pompeii was so completely covered that, nothing could be seen
of it. Thus it remained buried under the ground until the year
1748, when it was discovered by accident.</p>
<p>Since that time much of the city has been uncovered, and now
one can walk along the streets, look into the houses, and form
some idea how the people lived there eighteen hundred years
ago.</p>

<h3>ANECDOTE OF WASHINGTON.&mdash;PART I</h3>
<p>It was a calm, sunny day in the year 1750; the scene, a piece
of forest land in the north of Virginia, near a noble stream of
water.</p>
<p>Implements of surveying were lying about, and several men
reclining under the trees, indicated by their dress and
appearance, that they were engaged in laying out the wild lands
of the country.</p>
<p>These persons had just finished their dinner. Apart from the
group walked a young man of a tall and compact frame, who moved
with the firm and steady tread of one accustomed to constant
exercise in the open air.</p>
<p>His face wore a look of decision and manliness not usually
found in one so young, for he was but little over eighteen years
of age.</p>
<p>Suddenly there was a shriek, then another, and then several
more in rapid succession. The voice was that of a woman, and
seemed to proceed from the other side of a small piece of wooded
land.</p>
<p>At the first scream, the youth turned his head in the
direction of the sound; but when it was repeated, he pushed aside
the undergrowth and soon dashed into an open space on the banks
of the stream, where stood a small log-cabin.</p>
<p>As the young man broke from the undergrowth, he saw his
companions crowded together on the banks of the river, while in
their midst stood a woman, from whom proceeded the shrieks he had
heard. She was held by two of the men, but was struggling to free
herself.</p>
<p>The instant the woman saw the young man, she exclaimed, "O
sir, you will do something for me! Make them release me. My
boy&mdash;my poor boy is drowning, and they will not let me
go!"</p>
<p>"It would be madness; she will jump into the river," said one
of the men, "and the rapids would dash her to pieces in a
moment!"</p>
<p>The youth had scarcely waited for these words; for he
remembered the child, a bold little boy four years of age, whose
beautiful blue eyes and flaxen ringlets made him a favorite with
every one.</p>
<p>He had been accustomed to play in the little inclosure before
the cabin; but the gate having been left open, he had stolen out,
reached the edge of the bank, and was in the act of looking over,
when his mother saw him.</p>
<p>The shriek she uttered only hastened the accident she feared;
for the child, frightened at the cry of his mother, lost his
balance and fell into the stream, which here went foaming and
roaring along among rocks and dangerous rapids.</p>
<p>Several of the men approached the edge of the river, and were
on the point of springing in after the boy. But the sight of the
sharp rocks crowding the channel, the rush and whirl of the
waters, and the want of any knowledge where to look for the
child, deterred them, and they gave up the enterprise.</p>
<p>Not so with the noble youth. His first act was to throw off
his coat; next to spring to the edge of the bank. Here he stood
for a moment, running his eyes rapidly over the scene below,
taking in with a glance the different currents and the most
dangerous of the rocks, in order to shape his course when in the
stream.</p>
<p>He had scarcely formed his conclusion, when he saw in the
water a white object, which he knew was the boy's dress; and then
he plunged into the wild and roaring rapids.</p>
<p>"Thank God, he will save my child!" cried the mother; "there
he is!&mdash;O my boy, my darling boy! How could I leave
you!"</p>
<p>Every one had rushed to the brink of the precipice and were
now following with eager eyes the progress of the youth, as the
current bore him onward, like a feather in the power of a
hurricane.</p>
<p>Now it seemed as if he would be dashed against a projecting
rock, over which the water flew in foam, and a whirlpool would
drag him in, from whose grasp escape would appear impossible.</p>
<p>At times, the current bore him under, and he would be lost to
sight; then in a few seconds he would come to the surface again,
though his position would be far from where he had
disappeared.</p>
<p>Thus struggling amid the rocks and angry waters, was the noble
youth borne onward, eager to succeed in his perilous undertaking.
Those on shore looked on with breathless interest.</p>

<h3>ANECDOTE OF WASHINGTON.&mdash;PART II.</h3>
<p>O, how that mother's straining eyes followed the struggling
youth! How her heart sunk when he went under, and with what joy
she saw him emerge again from the waters, and, flinging the waves
aside with his strong arms, struggle on in pursuit of her
boy!</p>
<p>But it seemed as if his generous efforts were not to succeed;
for, though the current was bearing off the boy before his eyes,
scarcely ten feet distant, he could not overtake the drowning
child.</p>
<p>Twice the boy went out of sight; and a suppressed shriek
escaped the mother's lips; but twice he reappeared, and then,
with hands wrung wildly together, and breathless anxiety, she
followed his progress, as his form was hurried onward.</p>
<p>The youth now appeared to redouble his exertions, for they
were approaching the most dangerous part of the river.</p>
<p>The rush of waters at this spot was tremendous, and no one
ventured to approach it, even in a canoe, lest he should be
dashed to pieces.</p>
<p>What, then, would be the youth's fate, unless he soon overtook
the child? He seemed fully sensible of the increasing peril, and
now urged his way through the foaming current with a desperate
strength. Three times he was on the point of grasping the child,
when the water's whirled the prize from him.</p>
<p>The third effort was made just as they were entering within
the influence of the current above the falls; and when it failed,
the mother's heart sunk within her, and she groaned, fully
expecting the youth to give up his task.</p>
<p>But no; he only pressed forward the more eagerly; and, as they
breathlessly watched, amid the boiling waters, they saw the form
of the youth following close after that of the boy.</p>
<p>And now both pursuer and pursued shot to the brink of the
falls. An instant they hung there, distinctly visible amid the
foaming waters. Every brain grew dizzy at the sight.</p>
<p>But a shout burst from the spectators, when they saw the child
held aloft by the right arm of the youth&mdash;a shout that was
suddenly changed to a cry of horror, when they both vanished into
the raging waters below!</p>
<p>The mother ran forward, and then stood gazing with fixed eyes
at the foot of the falls. Suddenly she gave the glad cry, "There
they are! See! they are safe! Great God, I thank Thee!"</p>
<p>And, sure enough, there was the youth still unharmed. He had
just emerged from the boiling vortex below the falls. With, one
hand he held aloft the child, and with the other he was making
for the shore.</p>
<p>They ran, they shouted, they scarcely knew what they did,
until they reached his side, just as he was struggling to the
bank. They drew him out almost exhausted.</p>
<p>The boy was senseless; but his mother declared that he still
lived, as she pressed him to her bosom. The youth could scarcely
stand, so faint was he from his exertions.</p>
<p>Who can describe the scene that followed&mdash;the mother's
calmness while striving to bring her boy to life, and her wild
gratitude to his preserver, when the child was out of danger, and
sweetly sleeping in her arms?</p>
<p>"God will give you a reward," said she. "He will do great
things for you in return for this day's work, and the blessings
of thousands besides mine will attend you."</p>
<p>And so it was: for, to the hero of that hour were afterward
confided the destinies of a mighty nation. Throughout his long
career, what tended to make him honored and respected beyond all
men, was the spirit of self-sacrifice which, in the rescue of
that mother's child, as in the more important events of his life,
characterized George Washington.</p>

<h3>THE OSTRICH.</h3>
<p>The ostrich is the largest of all birds now existing, and is
found chiefly in the sandy deserts of Africa and Arabia.</p>
<p>A full-grown African ostrich stands from seven to nine feet in
height, to the top of its head, and will weigh from two to three
hundred pounds.</p>
<p>The body of the ostrich is large and massive; the legs are
long, measuring four feet or more, and the neck is of about the
same length as the legs.</p>
<p>The head is small for so large a bird; but its feet with their
two great toes are of good size, and possess astonishing
strength.</p>
<p>An ostrich's beak is short and blunt; its neck slender and
covered with gray down. Its eyes are large and bright, and the
sense of sight so keen that it can readily see a distance of from
four to six miles. It hears and sees equally well, and can only
be approached by stratagem.</p>
<p>The feathers of the male ostrich are of a glossy black, with
the exception of the large plumes of the wing-feathers, which in
both the male and female are snowy white.</p>
<p>To procure these beautiful white plumes is the chief object in
hunting the ostrich. Those plumes when plucked are sent to
foreign countries, and used to adorn ladies' hats, and for
various other purposes.</p>
<p>The ostrich feeds on vegetable substances; but as an aid to
digestion, it sometimes swallows stones, glass, paper, nails, and
pieces of wood.</p>
<p>An incident is related of an ostrich on exhibition in Paris,
swallowing a gold watch and chain. A gentleman approached within
reach of the beak of the bird, and, in the twinkling of an eye,
the watch and chain were snatched from his pocket and
swallowed.</p>
<p>Although the ostrich has wings, it can not fly&mdash;it
depends upon its strong legs and feet for speed, and can run much
faster than a horse.</p>
<p>The strength of the ostrich is marvelous. Its only weapon of
defence is its long and muscular leg.</p>
<div class="figright"><img alt="ostriches (65K)" src=
"images/303.jpg" height="500" width="371" /></div>
<p>It is accustomed to kick directly forward, and it is said by
those who have observed this habit, that a single blow from its
gigantic two-toed foot is sufficient to kill a panther, a jackal,
or a hyena.</p>
<p>No better idea of its strength can be given than the fact of
its being employed for riding. A traveler, writing about two
ostriches he saw in a village in Africa, says:</p>
<p>"These gigantic birds were so tame that two boys mounted
together the larger one. The ostrich no sooner felt their weight,
than it started off at full speed and carried them several times
around the village.</p>
<p>"This trial pleased me so much that I wished to have it
repeated; and in order to test their strength, I had a full-grown
man mount the smaller bird, and two men the larger bird.</p>
<p>"At first, they started with caution; but presently they spread
their wings and went off at such a speed that they seemed
scarcely to touch the ground."</p>
<p>The voice of the ostrich is deep and hollow, and is said to
resemble at times the roar of the lion. The bird frequently makes
a kind of cackling noise, and when enraged at an enemy, it hisses
very loudly.</p>
<p>Ostriches make their nests in the sand. One female will, in a
single season, lay from twenty to thirty eggs, weighing about
three pounds each.</p>
<p>Most of these she places in the nest, standing them on one
end; but some of them are left outside of the nest as food for
her young when they are hatched.</p>
<p>The natives of Africa are very fond of ostrich eggs, using
them for food. In taking the eggs, they exercise great caution;
for should the birds discover them, they would break all the eggs
and leave the nest.</p>
<p>Young ostriches are readily tamed. Some families in Africa
keep them as we do chickens. They play with children, sleep in
the houses, and when a family moves, the ostriches follow the
camels, frequently carrying the children on their backs.</p>
<p>Within the past few years, ostriches have been brought to this
country; and places called ostrich farms have been established in
California and other States, for the purpose of raising them for
their feathers.</p>

<h3>AN INCIDENT OF THE REVOLUTION.</h3>
<p>During the Revolutionary War, when the American people were
fighting for independence, a governor of one of the colonies
found himself in great danger of being captured by British
soldiers.</p>
<p>The governor, whose name was Griswold, contrived to reach the
house of a relative, and while there, was informed that the
soldiers had discovered his place of refuge and were then on
their way to seize him.</p>
<p>Griswold at once realizing that his peril was imminent,
determined, if possible, to reach a small stream, where he had
left a boat so hidden, by the foliage that it could not be seen
from the road.</p>
<p>In great haste and excitement, he left the house and proceeded
in the direction of the river. Passing through an orchard, he
encountered a young girl about twelve years old. She was watching
some pieces of linen cloth which were stretched out on the grass
for the purpose of bleaching.</p>
<p>Hetty&mdash;that was the girl's name&mdash;was seated under a
tree with her knitting, and had near her a pail of water, from
which she occasionally sprinkled the cloths to keep them
damp.</p>
<p>She started up and was somewhat frightened when she saw a man
leaping over the fence; but soon recognized him to be her
cousin.</p>
<p>"O, is it you, cousin!" exclaimed Hetty; "you frightened
me&mdash;where are you going?"</p>
<p>"Hetty," he replied, "the soldiers are seeking for me, and I
shall lose my life, unless I can reach the boat before they come.
I want you to run down toward the shore and meet them."</p>
<p>"They will surely ask for me; and then you must tell them that
I have gone up the road to catch the mail-cart, and they will
turn off the other way."</p>
<p>"But, cousin, how can I say so?&mdash;it would not be true. O,
why did you tell me which way you were going?"</p>
<p>"Would you betray me, Hetty, and see me put to death? Hark!
they are coming. I hear the clink of their horses' feet. Tell
them I have gone up the road and Heaven will bless you."</p>
<p>"Those who speak false words will never be happy," said Hetty.
"But they shall not compel me to tell which way you go, even if
they kill me&mdash;so run as fast as you can."</p>
<p>"I am afraid it is too late to run, Hetty; where can I hide
myself?"</p>
<p>"Be quick, cousin. Get down and lie under this cloth; I will
throw it over you and go on sprinkling the linen."</p>
<p>"I will do it, for it is my last chance."</p>
<p>He was soon concealed under the heavy folds of the long cloth.
A few minutes afterward, a party of cavalry dashed along the
road. An officer saw the girl and called out to her in a loud
voice&mdash;</p>
<p>"Have you seen a man run this way?"</p>
<p>"Yes, sir," replied Hetty.</p>
<p>"Which way did he go?"</p>
<p>"I promised not to tell, sir."</p>
<p>"But you must tell me this instant; or it will be worse for
you."</p>
<p>"I will not tell, for I must keep my word."</p>
<p>"Let me question her, for I think I know the child," said a
man who was guide to the party. "Is your name Hetty Marvin?"</p>
<p>"Yes, sir."</p>
<p>"Perhaps the man who ran past you was your cousin?"</p>
<p>"Yes, sir, he was."</p>
<p>"Well, we wish to speak with him. What did he say to you when,
he came by?"</p>
<p>"He told me that he had to run to save his life."</p>
<p>"Just so&mdash;that was quite true. I hope he will not have
far to run. Where was he going to hide himself?"</p>
<p>"My cousin said that he would go to the river to find a boat,
and he wanted me to tell the men in search of him that he had
gone the other way to meet the mail-cart."</p>
<p>"You are a good girl, Hetty, and we know you speak the truth.
What did your cousin say when he heard that you could not tell a
lie to save his life?"</p>
<p>"He asked, would I betray him and see him put to death?"</p>
<p>"And you said you would not tell, if you were killed for
it."</p>
<p>Poor Hetty's tears fell fast as she responded, "Yes, sir."</p>
<p>"Those were brave words, and I suppose he thanked you and ran
down the road as fast as he could?"</p>
<p>"I promised not to tell which way he went, sir."</p>
<p>"O yes, I forgot; but tell me his last words, and I will not
trouble you any more."</p>
<p>"He said, 'I will do it, for it is my last chance.'"</p>
<p>Hetty was now oppressed with great fear; she sobbed aloud, and
hid her face in her apron. The soldiers thought they had obtained
all the information they could, and rode off toward the
river-side.</p>
<p>While Griswold lay hidden at the farm, he had agreed upon a
signal with his boatmen, that if in trouble he would put a white
cloth by day, or a light at night, in the attic window of his
place of concealment. When either signal was seen, the men were
to be on the watch, ready to render him assistance in case of
need.</p>
<p>No sooner had the soldiers ridden away, than Griswold's
friends in the house hung out a white cloth from the window, to
warn the boatmen, who then pulled out to sea.</p>
<p>The boat, with two men in it, was nearly out of sight by the
time the soldiers reached the shore, and this caused them to
conclude that Griswold had effected his escape.</p>
<p>Meantime he lay safe and quiet until the time came for Hetty
to go home to supper. Then he requested her to go and ask her
mother to put the signal-lamp in the window as it grew dark, and
send him clothes and food. The signal was seen, the boat
returned, and Griswold made his way to it in safety.</p>
<p>In better days, when the war was over, and peace declared, he
named one of his daughters Hetty Marvin, that he might daily
think of the brave young cousin whose sense and truth-speaking
had saved his life.</p>

<h3>TROPICAL FRUITS.</h3>
<p>Those who have not visited tropical countries, can scarcely
imagine the wonders of their vegetation. There is nothing in the
northern half of the United States, with which to compare the
richness of the vegetable growth of the tropics.</p>
<p>In the Southern States of our Union, as well as in Mexico and
Central America, there are found many of the same plants and
trees that grow in countries lying still nearer the equator.</p>
<p>The various kinds of fruits which grow in these countries,
form a very large portion of the exports. Among those that are
most commonly sent to us, are bananas, oranges, lemons, dates,
cocoa-nuts, and figs.</p>
<p>In countries where the banana grows most abundantly, no
article of food which the natives can obtain, requires so little
trouble in its cultivation.</p>
<p>One has only to set out a few banana sprouts, and await the
result. In a short time, a juicy stem shoots up to the height of
fifteen or twenty feet.</p>
<p>It is formed of nothing more than a number of leaf stalks
rolled one over the other, and grows sometimes to a thickness of
two feet.</p>
<p>Two gigantic leaves grow out from the top, ten feet long and
two feet broad. They are so very thin and tender that a light
wind splits them into ribbons.</p>
<p>From the center of the leaves a very strong stalk rises up,
which supports the cluster of bananas. There are sometimes over
one hundred bananas to a single stalk.</p>
<p>A cluster of ripe bananas will weigh from sixty to seventy
pounds, and represents a large amount of food. When a stalk has
produced and ripened its fruit, it begins to wither and soon
dies.</p>
<p>In a very short time, however, new sprouts spring up from the
old root, and ere long the native has another cluster. So rapidly
do they follow each other, that one cluster is scarcely consumed
before another one is ready to ripen.</p>
<p>Bananas ripened on the stalk will not bear transportation to
any great distance; therefore, when selected for export, the
clusters are cut off while the bananas are very green.</p>
<p>Another valuable fruit of the tropics is the date. This fruit
grows on a tree called the date-palm, that is found in both Asia
and Africa.</p>
<p>The date-palm is a majestic tree, rising to the height of
sixty feet or more, without branches, and with a trunk of uniform
thickness throughout its entire length.</p>
<p>It begins to bear fruit about eight years after it has been
planted, and continues to be productive from seventy to one
hundred years.</p>
<p>Dates are oval in shape, and have a long solid stone. They
form the principal food of the inhabitants of some of the eastern
countries, and are an important article of commerce.</p>
<p>When they are perfectly ripe, they possess a delightful
perfume, and are very agreeable to the taste.</p>
<p>In preparing dates to be sent to distant countries, they are
gathered a short time before they are quite ripe, dried in the
sun on mats, and finally packed in boxes or straw sacks.</p>
<p>Travelers in the deserts of Africa, often carry dried dates
with them for their chief food, during a journey of hundreds of
miles.</p>
<p>The Arabs grind dried dates into a powder which they call date
flour. If this is packed away in a dry place, it will keep for
years, and only has to be moistened with a little water to
prepare it for eating.</p>
<p>One of the most valuable and productive of tropical trees is
the cocoa-nut palm. It grows largely in both the East and West
Indies, and elsewhere throughout the torrid zone.</p>
<p>It rises to a height of from sixty to one hundred feet, and
terminates in a crown, of graceful, waving leaves. Some of these
leaves reach a length of twenty feet, and have the appearance of
gigantic feathers.</p>
<p>The fruit consists of a thick outward husk of a fibrous
structure, and within this, is the ordinary cocoa-nut of
commerce.</p>
<p>The shell of the nut is hard and woody, and a little over a
quarter of an inch in thickness. Next to this shell is the
kernel, which is also a shell about half an inch thick, and
composed of a white substance very pleasant to the taste. Within
this white eatable shell, is a milky liquid, called cocoa-nut
milk.</p>
<div class="figright"><img alt="cocoa-nut palms (65K)" src=
"images/318.jpg" height="500" width="343" /></div>
<p>The cocoa-nut is very useful to the natives of the regions in
which it grows. The nuts supply a large portion of their food,
and the milky fluid inclosed within, forms a pleasant and
refreshing drink.</p>
<p>The shell of the nut is made into cups, and from the kernel,
cocoa-nut oil is pressed out and largely used in making soap and
for other purposes.</p>
<p>In Ceylon, the tree is cultivated extensively. It is estimated
that there are twenty million trees in that island, and that each
tree produces about sixty nuts yearly. The wealth of a native is
based upon the number of cocoa-nut palms he owns.</p>
<p>Another well-known tropical fruit is the fig, which grows on a
bush or small tree about eighteen or twenty feet high.</p>
<p>The fig-tree is now cultivated in all the Mediterranean
countries, but the larger portion of the American supply comes
from western Asia and the south of France.</p>
<p>The varieties are extremely numerous, and the fruit is of
various colors, from deep purple to yellow, or nearly white.</p>
<p>The trees usually bear two crops&mdash;one in the early
summer, the other in the autumn.</p>
<p>When ripe, the figs are picked and spread out to dry in the
sun. Thus prepared, the fruit is packed closely in barrels,
baskets, or wooden boxes, for commerce.</p>
<p>Oranges and lemons are cultivated in nearly all warm
countries. They grow on trees somewhat smaller than apple trees,
and must be picked for export while they are hard and green.</p>
<p>They ripen during transportation, so that green oranges put up
and sent to us from Sicily or other distant points, change to a
golden yellow color by the time they reach us.</p>
<p>Oranges are grown largely in Florida and Louisiana, extensive
orange orchards being frequently met with in traveling through
those States. The oranges grown there are considered very choice,
and are generally sweeter than those brought from Italy.</p>

<h3>THE STORY OF DETROIT.</h3>
<p>The early history of Detroit is highly romantic. It was
founded in 1701 as a military colony.</p>
<p>It soon became one of the most important of the western
outposts of Canada, and as the French and Indians were usually on
the most friendly terms, the colony for a long time existed in a
state of happiness and contentment.</p>
<p>At the close of the French War, Detroit contained over two
thousand inhabitants. Canadian dwellings with their lovely
gardens lined the banks of the river for miles.</p>
<p>Within the limits of the settlement were several Indian
villages. Here the light-hearted French-Canadian smoked his pipe
and told his story, and the friendly Indian supplied him with
game and joined in his merry-making.</p>
<p>In the year 1760, Detroit was taken possession of by the
English. The Indians hated the English, as much as they had loved
the French.</p>
<p>Pontiac, the ruling spirit of the forests at this time, was a
most powerful and statesmanlike chief. When he found that his
friends, the French, had lost their power, he sought to unite the
Indian tribes against the English colonies, and to destroy the
English garrison at Detroit by strategy.</p>
<p>He was chief of the Ottawas, but possessed great influence
over several other tribes. Pontiac believed, and that truly, that
the establishment of English colonies would be fatal to the
interests of the Indian race.</p>
<p>He strode through the forests like a giant, inciting the
tribes to war. He urged a union of all the Indian nations from
the lakes to the Mississippi for the common defense of the
race.</p>
<p>There lived near Detroit a beautiful Indian girl, called
Catharine. The English commander, Gladwyn, was pleased with her,
and showed her many favors, and she formed a warm friendship for
him.</p>
<p>One lovely day in May, this girl came to the fort and brought
Gladwyn a pair of elk-skin moccasins. She appeared very sad.</p>
<p>"Catharine," said Gladwyn, "what troubles you to-day?"</p>
<p>She did not answer at once. There was a silent struggle going
on in her heart. She had formed a strong attachment for the white
people, and she was also devoted to her own race.</p>
<p>"To-morrow," she said at length, "Pontiac will come to the
fort with sixty of his chiefs. Each will be armed with a gun,
which will be cut short and hidden under his blanket. The chief
will ask to hold a council. He will then make a speech, and offer
a belt of wampum as a peace-offering.</p>
<p>"As soon as he holds up the belt, the chiefs will spring up
and shoot the officers, and the Indians outside will attack the
English. Every Englishman will be killed. The French inhabitants
will be spared."</p>
<p>Gladwyn made immediate preparations to avoid the danger which
threatened them. The soldiers were put under arms. Orders were
given to have them drawn up in line on the arrival of the Indians
the following day.</p>
<p>The next morning Indian canoes approached the fort from the
eastern shores. They contained Pontiac and his sixty chiefs. At
ten o'clock the chiefs marched to the fort, in fantastic
procession. Each wore a colored blanket, and was painted, plumed,
or in some way gaily ornamented.</p>
<p>As Pontiac entered the fort, a glance showed him that his plot
was discovered. He passed in amazement through glittering rows of
steel, he made a speech, expressing friendship; but he did not
dare to lift the wampum belt which was to have been the signal
for attack. He was allowed to depart peaceably.</p>
<p>When he found that his plot had been discovered, his anger
knew no bounds. He gathered his warriors from every hand and laid
siege to Detroit. He was defeated, and with his defeat ended the
power of the Indian tribes in the region of the Upper Lakes.</p>
<p>Detroit became an English town, and afterward an American
city. She has gathered to herself the wealth of the fertile
regions which lie around her, as well as the commerce of the
broad inland seas on either hand. To-day she has more than one
hundred and twenty thousand inhabitants, and is famous for her
wealth and culture.</p>

<h3>MAKING MAPLE SUGAR.&mdash;PART I.</h3>
<p>There is no part of farming that a boy enjoys more than the
making of maple sugar; it is better than "blackberrying," and
nearly as good as fishing.</p>
<p>And one reason he likes this work is that somebody else does
the most of it. It is a sort of work in which he can appear to be
very active, and yet not do much.</p>
<p>In my day maple-sugar-making used to be something between
picnicking and being shipwrecked on a fertile island, where one
should save from the wreck, tubs and augers, and great kettles
and pork, and hen's-eggs and rye-and-indian bread, and begin at
once to lead the sweetest life in the world.</p>
<p>I am told that it is something different nowadays, and that
there is more desire to save the sap, and make good, pure sugar,
and sell it for a large price.</p>
<p>I am told that it is the custom to carefully collect the sap
and bring it to the house, where there are built brick arches,
over which it is evaporated in shallow pans, and that pains are
taken to keep the leaves, sticks, ashes and coals out of it, and
that the sugar is clarified.</p>
<p>In short, that it is a money-making business, in which there
is very little fun, and that the boy is not allowed to dip his
paddle into the kettle of boiling sugar and lick off the
delicious syrup.</p>
<p>As I remember, the country boy used to be on the lookout in
the spring for the sap to begin running. I think he discovered it
as soon as anybody.</p>
<p>Perhaps he knew it by a feeling of something starting in his
own veins&mdash;a sort of spring stir in his legs and arms, which
tempted him to stand on his head, or throw a handspring, if he
could find a spot of ground from which the snow had melted.</p>
<p>The sap stirs early in the legs of a country boy, and shows
itself in uneasiness in the toes, which, get tired of boots, and
want to come out and touch the soil just as soon as the sun has
warmed it a little.</p>
<p>The country boy goes barefoot just as naturally as the trees
burst their buds, which were packed and varnished over in the
fall to keep the water and the frost out.</p>
<p>Perhaps the boy has been out digging into the maple-trees with
his jack-knife; at any rate, he is pretty sure to announce the
discovery as he comes running into the house in a state of great
excitement, with "Sap's runnin'!"</p>
<p>And then, indeed, the stir and excitement begin. The
sap-buckets, which have been stored in the wood-house, are
brought down and set out on the south side of the house and
scalded.</p>
<p>The snow is still a foot or more deep in the woods, and the
ox-sled is got out to make a road to the sugar camp. The boy is
every-where present, superintending every thing, asking
questions, and filled with a desire to help the excitement.</p>
<p>It is a great day when the cart is loaded with the buckets,
and the procession starts into the woods. The sun shines
brightly; the snow is soft and beginning to sink down; the
snow-birds are twittering about, and the noise of shouting and of
the blows of the axe echoes far and wide.</p>
<p>In the first place the men go about and tap the trees, drive
in the spouts, and hang the buckets under. The boy watches all
these operations with the greatest interest.</p>
<p>He wishes that some time when a hole is bored into a tree that
the sap would spout out in a stream, as it does when a
cider-barrel is tapped.</p>
<p>But it never does, it only drops, sometimes almost in a
stream, but on the whole slowly, and the boy learns that the
sweet things of the world have to be patiently waited for, and do
not usually come otherwise than drop by drop.</p>
<p>Then the camp is to be cleared of snow. The shanty is
re-covered with boughs. In front of it two enormous logs are
rolled nearly together, and a fire is built between them.</p>
<p>Forked sticks are set at each end, and a long pole is laid on
them, and on this are hung the great iron kettles. The huge
hogsheads are turned right side up, and cleaned out to receive
the sap that is gathered.</p>
<p>The great fire that is kindled is never allowed to go out,
night or day, so long as the season lasts. Somebody is always
cutting wood to feed it; somebody is busy most of the time
gathering in the sap.</p>
<p>Somebody is required to watch the kettles that they do not
boil over, and to fill them. It is not the boy, however; he is
too busy with things in general to be of any use in details.</p>
<p>He has his own little sap-yoke and small pails, with which he
gathers the sweet liquid. He has a little boiling-place of his
own, with small logs and a tiny kettle.</p>

<h3>MAKING MAPLE SUGAR.&mdash;PART II.</h3>
<p>In the great kettles the boiling of the sap goes on slowly,
and the liquid, as it thickens, is dipped from one to another,
until in the end kettle it is reduced to syrup, and is taken out
to cool and settle, until enough is made to "sugar off."</p>
<p>To "sugar off" is to boil the syrup until it is thick enough
to crystallize into sugar. This is the grand event, and is only
done once in two or three days.</p>
<p>But the boy's desire is to "sugar off" all the time. He boils
his kettle down as rapidly as possible; he is not particular
about chips, scum, or ashes.</p>
<p>He is apt to burn his sugar; but if he can get enough to make
a little wax on the snow, or to scrape from the bottom of the
kettle with his wooden paddle, he is happy.</p>
<p>A great deal is wasted on his hands, and the outside of his
face, and on his clothes, but he does not care; he is not
stingy.</p>
<p>To watch the operations of the big fire gives him constant
pleasure. Sometimes he is left to watch the boiling kettles, with
a piece of pork tied on the end of a stick, which he dips into
the boiling mass when it threatens to go over.</p>
<p>He is constantly tasting of it, however, to see if it is not
almost syrup. He has a long, round stick, whittled smooth at one
end, which he uses for this purpose, at the constant risk of
burning his tongue.</p>
<p>The smoke blows in his face; he is grimy with ashes; he is
altogether such a mass of dirt, stickiness, and sweetness, that
his own mother wouldn't know him.</p>
<p>He likes to boil eggs with the hired man in the hot sap; he
likes to roast potatoes in the ashes, and he would live in the
camp day and night if he were permitted.</p>
<p>To sleep there with the men, and awake in the night and hear
the wind in the trees, and see the sparks fly up to the sky, is a
perfect realization of all the stories of adventures he has ever
read.</p>
<p>He tells the other boys afterward that he heard something in
the night that sounded very much like a bear. The hired man says
that he was very much scared by the hooting of an owl.</p>
<p>The great occasions for the boy, though, are the times of
"sugaring off." Sometimes this used to be done in the evening,
and it was made the excuse for a frolic in the camp.</p>
<p>The neighbors were invited; sometimes even the pretty girls
from the village, who filled all the woods with their sweet
voices and merry laughter, were there, too.</p>
<p>The tree branches all show distinctly in the light of the
fire, which lights up the bough shanty, the hogsheads, the
buckets on the trees, and the group about the boiling kettles,
until the scene is like something taken out of a fairy play.</p>
<p>At these sugar parties every one was expected to eat as much
sugar as possible; and those who are practiced in it can eat a
great deal.</p>
<p>It is a peculiar fact about eating warm maple sugar, that
though you may eat so much of it one day as to be sick, you will
want it the next day more than ever.</p>
<p>At the "sugaring off" they used to pour the hot sugar upon the
snow, where it congealed into a sort of wax, which I suppose is
the most delicious substance that was ever invented. And it takes
a great while to eat it.</p>
<p>If you should close your teeth firmly on a lump of it, you
would be unable to open your mouth until it dissolved. The
sensation while it is melting is very pleasant, but it will not
do to try to talk, for you can not.</p>
<p>The boy used to make a big lump of it and give it to the dog,
who seized it with great avidity, and closed his jaws on it, as
dogs will on any thing.</p>
<p>It was funny the next moment to see the expression of perfect
surprise on the dog's face when he found that he could not open
his jaws.</p>
<p>He shook his head; he sat down in despair; he ran round in a
circle; he dashed into the woods and back again.</p>
<p>He did every thing except climb a tree, and howl. It would
have been such a relief to him if he could have howled. But that
was the one thing he could not do.</p>

<h3>OLD IRONSIDES.</h3>
<p>During our second war with Great Britain, which began in the
year 1812, many battles were fought both on land and sea.</p>
<p>Among the ships of war belonging to the United States
Government, was a frigate named the Constitution. She was built
about the beginning of the present century, and owing to her good
fortune in many engagements, her seamen gave her the name of "Old
Ironsides."</p>
<p>She was in active service throughout the entire war, and
captured five ships of war from the British, two of which were
frigates.</p>
<p>In all her service, her success was remarkable. She never lost
her masts, never went ashore, and though so often in battle, no
very serious loss of life ever occurred on her decks. Her entire
career was that of what is called in the navy "a lucky ship."</p>
<p>Perhaps this may be explained by the fact that she always had
excellent commanders, and that she probably possessed as fine a
ship's company as ever manned a frigate.</p>
<p>In 1829, the Government ordered the Constitution to be
dismantled and taken to pieces, because she had become unfit for
service.</p>
<p>At that time, Oliver Wendell Holmes, who has since become
famous as a writer, was a young man twenty years of age, about
completing his studies at Harvard College.</p>
<p>When he heard of the intended destruction of "Old Ironsides,"
he went directly to his room, and, inspired by patriotic
feelings, wrote the following poem.</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p class="i4"><b>OLD IRONSIDES.</b></p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>Ay, tear her tattered ensign down!</p>
<p class="i2">Long has it waved on high,</p>
<p>And many an eye has danced to see</p>
<p class="i2">That banner in the sky;</p>
<p>Beneath it rung the battle shout</p>
<p class="i2">And burst the cannons' roar:</p>
<p>The meteor of the ocean air</p>
<p class="i2">Shall sweep the clouds no more.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>Her deck, once red with heroes' blood,</p>
<p class="i2">Where knelt the vanquished foe,</p>
<p>When winds were hurrying o'er the flood</p>
<p class="i2">And waves were white below,</p>
<p>No more shall feel the victors' tread,</p>
<p class="i2">Or know the conquered knee:</p>
<p>The harpies of the shore shall pluck</p>
<p class="i2">The eagle of the sea!</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>O, better that her shattered hulk</p>
<p class="i2">Should sink beneath the wave!&mdash;</p>
<p>Her thunders shook the mighty deep,</p>
<p class="i2">And there should be her grave.</p>
<p>Nail to the mast her holy flag,</p>
<p class="i2">Set every threadbare sail,</p>
<p>And give her to the god of storms,</p>
<p class="i2">The lightning, and the gale!</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>The effect of this poem upon the people was so great that a
general outcry arose against the destruction of the gallant old
ship.</p>
<p>The Government was induced to reconsider its determination.
The old ship was saved, repaired, and for many years has
delighted the eyes of thousands of people who have visited
her.</p>
<p>At present, she is used as a receiving-ship at the United
States Navy Yard, Portsmouth, New Hampshire.</p>

<h3>NATURAL WONDERS OF AMERICA.&mdash;PART I.</h3>
<p>Within the vast extent of territory belonging to the United
States, there are many wonderful natural curiosities which
attract visitors from all parts of the world.</p>
<p>A short description of some of the principal attractions is
here given, with the hope that many who read this lesson, may at
some time visit a part or all that are noticed.</p>
<h3>GEYSERS OF THE YELLOWSTONE PARK.</h3>
<p>The Yellowstone Park is a tract of country fifty-five by
sixty-five miles in extent, lying mainly in the northwest corner
of the Territory of Wyoming, but including a narrow belt in
southern Montana. It contains nearly thirty-six hundred square
miles, and is nearly three times as large as the State of Rhode
Island. No equal extent of country on the globe comprises such a
union of grand and wonderful scenery.</p>
<p>Numerous hot springs, steam jets, and extinct geyser cones
exist in the Yellowstone basin. Just beyond the western rim of
the basin, lies the grand geyser region of Fire-Hole River.</p>
<p>Scattered along both banks of this stream are boiling springs
from two to twelve feet across, all in active operation.</p>
<p>One of the most noted geysers of this district is "Old
Faithful." It stands on a mound thirty feet high, the crater
rising some six feet higher still.</p>
<p>The eruptions take place about once an hour, and continue
fifteen or twenty minutes, the column of water shooting upward
with terrific force, from one hundred to one hundred and fifty
feet.</p>
<p>The great mass of water falls directly back into the basin,
flowing over the edges and down the sides in large streams. When
the action ceases, the water recedes from sight, and nothing is
heard but an occasional escape of steam until another eruption
occurs.</p>
<div class="figright"><img alt="geyser (70K)" src=
"images/344.jpg" height="500" width="330" /></div>
<p>Just across the river and close to the margin, a small conical
mound is observed, about three feet high, and five feet in
diameter at the base.</p>
<p>No one would suspect it to be an active geyser. But in 1871, a
column of water entirely filling the crater shot from it, which
by actual measurement was found to be two hundred and nineteen
feet high.</p>
<p>Not more than a hundred yards from the river, there is a large
oval aperture eighteen feet wide and twenty-five feet long. The
sides are covered with a grayish-white deposit which is
distinctly visible at a depth of a hundred feet below the
surface.</p>
<p>This geyser is known as the "Giantess," and a visitor in
describing it states that "no water could be discovered on the
first approach, but it could be distinctly heard gurgling and
boiling at a great distance below. Suddenly it began to rise,
spluttering and sending out huge volumes of steam, causing a
general scattering of our company.</p>
<p>"When within about forty feet of the surface, it became
stationary, and we returned to look upon it. All at once it rose
with incredible rapidity, the hot water bursting from the opening
with terrific force, rising in a column the full size of this
immense aperture to the height of sixty feet.</p>
<p>"Through, and out of the top of this mass, five or six lesser
jets or round columns of water, varying in size from six to
fifteen inches in diameter, were projected to the marvelous
height of two hundred and fifty feet."</p>
<h3>THE CA&Ntilde;ONS OF THE COLORADO RIVER.</h3>
<p>The length of the Colorado River, from the sources of the
Green River, is about two thousand miles.</p>
<p>For five hundred miles of this distance, the river has worn
deep cuts or gorges through the soft rock, called
ca&ntilde;ons.</p>
<div class="figright"><img alt="grand canyon (49K)" src=
"images/346.jpg" height="500" width="299" />
<p class="center">View in the Grand Ca&ntilde;on</p>
</div>
<p>The rocky sides of these ca&ntilde;ons form lofty vertical
walls, which, in some places, rise to a height of more than a
mile above the surface of the water.</p>
<p>The largest and most noted of these vast gorges is the Grand
Ca&ntilde;on, which extends a distance of more than two hundred
miles. The height of the walls of this ca&ntilde;on varies from
four thousand to seven thousand feet.</p>
<p>The river, as it runs through it, is from fifty to three
hundred feet wide. So swift is the current, that it is almost
impossible to float a boat down the stream without having it
dashed to pieces against the rocky walls on either side.</p>
<p>The first descent through these ca&ntilde;ons was made in 1867, from
a point on Grand River, about thirty miles above its junction
with Green River.</p>
<p>Three men were prospecting for gold, and being attacked by
Indians and one of their number killed, the other two decided to
attempt the descent of the river, rather than retrace their steps
through a country where Indians were numerous.</p>
<p>They constructed a raft of a few pieces of drift-wood, and
having secured their arms and provisions, commenced their journey
down the stream.</p>
<p>A few days afterward, while the raft was descending a
cataract, one of the men was drowned and all the provisions were
washed overboard.</p>
<p>The third man, hemmed in by the walls of the ca&ntilde;on,
continued the journey alone amid great perils from cataracts,
rocks, and whirlpools.</p>
<p>For ten days he pursued, his lonely way, tasting food but
twice during the whole time. Once he obtained a few green pods
and leaves from bushes growing along the stream, and the second
time from some friendly Indians.</p>
<p>At last he succeeded in reaching Callville in safety, after
having floated several hundred miles.</p>

<p>In the year 1809, a hunter named Hutchins, while pursuing a
bear in Edmondson County, Kentucky, was surprised to see the
animal disappear into a small opening in the side of a hill.</p>
<p>Upon examining the spot, Hutchins found that the opening led
into a cave. Following up the examination soon after, it was
discovered that the cave was immense in its proportions.</p>
<p>On account of its great size, it was named Mammoth Cave. It
has an area of several hundred square miles, and two hundred and
twenty-three known and numbered avenues, with a united length of
from one hundred and fifty to two hundred miles.</p>
<p>The interior of this cave is divided by huge columns and walls
of stone into chambers of various shapes and sizes. Some of these
are large enough to afford standing room for thousands of
people.</p>
<p>One of the largest of these chambers is called Mammoth Dome.
This room is four hundred feet long, one hundred and fifty feet
wide, and two hundred and fifty feet in height.</p>
<p>The walls of this grand room are curtained by alabaster
drapery in vertical folds and present to the eye a scene of
unexampled beauty and grandeur.</p>
<p>A large gateway at one end of this room opens into another
room, in which the position of the huge stone pillars, reminds
one of the ruins of some ancient temple.</p>
<p>Six colossal columns, or pillars, eighty feet high and
twenty-five feet in diameter, standing in a half circle, are
among the imposing attractions of this wonderful room.</p>
<p>Another striking feature of Mammoth Cave is what is called the
Dead Sea. This body of water is four hundred feet long, forty
feet wide, and very deep.</p>
<p>A curious fish is found in this dark lake. It is without eyes,
and, in form and color, is different from any fish found outside
the cave.</p>
<p>There are found also a blind grasshopper, without wings, and a
blind crayfish of a whitish color, both of which are very curious
and interesting.</p>
<p>The fact that these living creatures are blind would seem to
indicate that nature had produced them for the distinct purpose
of inhabiting this dark cave.</p>
<h3>NIAGARA FALLS.</h3>
<p>Of all the sights to be seen on this continent, there is none
that equals the great Falls of Niagara River, situated about
twelve miles north of Buffalo, in the State of New York.</p>
<p>On first beholding this most wonderful of all known cataracts,
one is overawed by its surpassing grandeur, "and stunned by the
sound of the falling waters as by a roar of thunder."</p>
<p>For quite a distance above the falls, the Niagara River is
about one mile wide, and flows with great swiftness.</p>
<p>Just at the edge of the cataract stands Goat Island, which
divides the waters of the river, and makes two distinct
cataracts; one on the Canadian side, and one on the American side
of the river.</p>
<p>The one on the Canadian side, called from its shape the
Horse-shoe Fall, is eighteen hundred feet wide, and one hundred,
and fifty-eight feet high. The other, called the American Fall,
is six hundred feet wide, and one hundred and sixty-four feet
high.</p>
<p>As the immense body of water leaps over this vast precipice,
it breaks into a soft spray, which waves like a plume in the
wind. At times, when the rays of the sun strike this spray, a
rainbow is formed which stretches itself across the deep chasm,
and produces a beautiful effect.</p>
<p>During the winter, much of the water and spray freezes, and as
each moment adds to the frozen mass, some curious and wonderful
ice formations are produced.</p>
<p>Sometimes, during a very cold winter, the ice at the foot of
the falls forms a complete bridge from one shore to the
other.</p>
<p>An interesting feature of a visit to these falls is a descent
to the level of the foot of the cataract behind the great sheet
of water.</p>
<p>A long flight of steps leads down to a secure footing between
the rocky precipice and the falling torrent. By a narrow
footpath, it is possible for the visitor to pass between this
column of water and the wall of rock.</p>
<p>Once behind the sheet of water, the roar is deafening. One can
only cling to the narrow railing or his guide, as he picks his
way for more than a hundred feet behind the roaring torrent.</p>
<p>A single misstep, a slip, or a fall, and nothing remains but a
horrible death by being dashed to pieces upon the jagged rocks
below.</p>

<h3>AFRICAN ANTS.</h3>
<p>A strange kind of ant is very abundant in the whole region I
have traveled over in Africa, and is the most voracious creature
I ever met. It is the dread of all living animals, from the
leopard to the smallest insect.</p>
<p>I do not think that these ants build nests or homes of any
kind. At any rate they carry nothing away, but eat all their prey
on the spot. It is their habit to march through the forests in a
long, regular line&mdash;a line about two inches broad and often
several miles in length. All along this line are larger ants, who
act as officers, stand outside the ranks, and keep this singular
army in order.</p>
<p>If they come to a place where there are no trees to shelter
them from the sun, whose heat they can not bear, they immediately
build underground tunnels, through which the whole army passes in
columns to the forest beyond. These tunnels are four or five feet
underground, and are used only in the heat of the day, or during
a storm.</p>
<p>When, they grow hungry the long file spreads itself through
the forest in a front line, and attacks and devours all it
overtakes with a fury which is quite irresistible. The elephant
and gorilla fly before this attack. The black men run for their
lives. Every animal that lives in their line of march is
chased.</p>
<p>They seem to understand and act upon the tactics of Napoleon,
and concentrate with great speed their heaviest forces upon the
point of attack. In an incredibly short space of time the mouse,
or dog, or leopard, or deer, is overwhelmed, killed, eaten, and
the bare skeleton only remains.</p>
<p>They seem to travel night and day. Many a time have I been
awakened out of a sleep, and obliged to rush from the hut and
into the water to save my life, and after all suffered
intolerable agony from the bites of the advance-guard, that had
got into my clothes.</p>
<p>When they enter a house they clear it of all living things.
Cockroaches are devoured in an instant. Rats and mice spring
round the room in vain. An overwhelming force of ants kill a
strong rat in less than a minute, in spite of the most frantic
struggles, and in less than another minute its bones are
stripped. Every living thing in the house is devoured.</p>
<p>They will not touch vegetable matter. Thus they are in reality
very useful, as well as dangerous, to the natives, who have their
huts cleaned of all the abounding vermin, such as immense
cockroaches and centipedes, at least several times a year.</p>
<p>When on their march the insect world flies before them, and I
have often had the approach of an ant-army heralded to me by this
means. Wherever they go they make a clean sweep, even ascending
to the tops of the highest trees in pursuit of their prey.</p>
<p>Their manner of attack is an impetuous leap. Instantly the
strong pincers are fastened, and they let go only when the piece
gives way.</p>
<p>At such times this little animal seems animated by a kind of
fury which causes it to disregard entirely its own safety, and to
seek only the conquest of its prey. The bite of these ants is
very painful.</p>
<p>The natives relate that in former times it was the custom to
expose criminals in the path of these ants, as the most cruel way
that was known of putting them to death.</p>

<h3>EGYPT AND ITS RUINS.&mdash;PART I.</h3>
<p>Egypt embraces that part of Africa occupied by the valley of
the River Nile. For many centuries, it was a thickly populated
country, and at one time possessed great influence and wealth,
and had reached an advanced state of civilization.</p>
<p>The history of Egypt extends through a period of about six
thousand years. During this time great cities were built which
flourished for hundreds of years.</p>
<p>Owing to wars and changes of government many of these cities
were destroyed, and nothing of them now remains but massive and
extensive ruins.</p>
<p>Pyramids were built, obelisks erected, canals projected, and
many other vast enterprises were carried out.</p>
<div class="figright"><img alt="pyramid pastiche (82K)" src=
"images/363.jpg" height="500" width="404" /></div>
<p>Remains of these are to be seen to-day, some in ruins, some
fairly preserved, and, altogether, they give present generations
an idea of the wealth and power of the different dynasties under
which they were built.</p>
<p>Not far from Cairo, which is now the principal city of Egypt,
are the famous pyramids. These are of such immense proportions,
that from a distance their tops seem to reach the clouds.</p>
<p>They are constructed of blocks of stone. Some of these blocks
are of great size, and how the builders ever put them into their
places, is a question we can not answer.</p>
<p>It is supposed that the construction of one of these pyramids
required more than twenty years' labor from thousands of men.</p>
<p>The largest pyramid is four hundred and sixty-one feet high,
seven hundred and forty-six feet long at the base, and covers
more than twelve acres of ground. In all, sixty-seven of these
pyramids have been discovered and explored.</p>
<p>They are the tombs in which the ancient kings and their
families were buried. In the interior of these pyramids, many
chambers were constructed to contain their stone coffins.</p>
<p>It has been calculated that one of the principal pyramids
could contain three thousand seven hundred rooms of large
size.</p>
<p>The bodies of those who were buried in the pyramids were
preserved from decay by a secret process, known only to the
priests.</p>
<div class="figright"><img alt="mummy (6K)" src="images/365.jpg"
height="63" width="250" /></div>
<p>After the bodies were prepared, they were wrapped in bands of
fine linen, and on the inside of these was spread a peculiar kind
of gum. There were sometimes a thousand yards of these bands on a
single body.</p>
<p>After they were thus prepared, a soft substance was placed
around the bandaged body. This covering, when it hardened, kept
the body in a complete state of preservation.</p>
<div class="figleft"><img alt="sarcophagus (39K)" src=
"images/3651.jpg" height="250" width="401" /></div>
<p>These coverings are now called mummy-cases, and the bodies
they inclose, mummies.</p>
<p>These bodies were finally placed, in huge stone coffins, many
of which were covered with curious carvings.</p>
<p>Some of these mummies have been found, that are said to be
over three thousand years old. However, when the wrappings are
removed from them, many of the bodies have been so well
preserved, as to exhibit the appearance of the features as in
life.</p>
<p>Large numbers of these mummies have been carried to other
countries and placed on exhibition in museums.</p>
<p>Among the mummies brought to this country, are some of the
best specimens which have yet been discovered.</p>

<h3>EGYPT AND ITS RUINS.&mdash;PART II.</h3>
<p>The ancient Egyptians erected many obelisks in various parts
of their country. These were monuments made from single pieces of
hard stone, and in some cases reached a height of more than a
hundred feet.</p>
<p>They were placed before gateways leading to the principal
temples and palaces, and were covered with curious carvings in
the stone, which represented the language of the people at that
time.</p>
<p>It thus appears that their written language was not composed
of letters and words alone, like our own; but that they used
pictures of animals, including birds, human figures, and other
devices of a singular nature, to express their thoughts and
ideas.</p>
<p>Until the year 1799, it was impossible for the scholars of
modern nations to read this strange language. In that year,
however, a stone tablet was discovered by a French engineer,
containing an inscription written in three languages.</p>
<p>One of these was in the characters of the ancient Egyptian and
another in those of the Greek. Upon translating the Greek
writing, it was discovered to be a copy of the inscription in the
Egyptian language.</p>
<p>By comparing the words of these inscriptions with many others,
the formation of this peculiar language was ascertained. It was
then learned that the inscriptions on these obelisks were the
records of memorable events, and the heroic deeds of their kings
and heroes.</p>
<p>Many of these obelisks have been taken from their positions in
Egypt and transported with great labor to other countries. Nearly
two thousand years ago the Roman emperors began to carry them to
the city of Rome. Altogether, nearly fifty of these remarkable
monuments were taken away and set up in that city. They were
then, as now, regarded as curious examples of the ingenuity of
the ancients who first made them.</p>
<div class="figright"><img alt="obelisk in central park (46K)" src=
"images/369.jpg" height="500" width="335" />
<p class="center">The Obelisk in Central Park, New York,<br />
and as it appeared in Egypt.</p>
</div>
<p>In later years, specimens were taken to Paris and London, and
more recently one was brought to America, and set up in the
Central Park, New York City.</p>
<p>This one belongs to the largest class, being nearly seventy
feet high and about eight feet square at the base.</p>
<p>The accompanying cut shows the position of this obelisk as it
appeared when standing near the city of Alexandria, Egypt.</p>
<p>The difficulty of transporting one of these huge stone columns
is so great, that for a long time it was thought impossible to
remove it from Egypt to this country.</p>
<p>In their large cities, the Egyptians built massive temples
which were dedicated to religious ceremonies. Some of them,
although now in ruins, are considered to be among the most
remarkable productions of the ancients.</p>
<p>Tourists who nowadays sail up the River Nile and visit the
site of the city of Thebes, the ancient capital of Egypt, are
struck with amazement at the vast ruins surrounding them.</p>
<p>On the eastern side of the Nile lies what is left of the
temple of Karnak.</p>
<p>Imagine a long line of courts, gateways, and halls; here and
there an obelisk rising above the ruins, and shutting off the
view of the forest of columns!</p>
<p>This mass of ruins, some lying in huge heaps of stone, others
perfect and pointed as when they were first built, is approached
on every side by avenues and gateways of colossal grandeur.</p>
<p>The temple originally covered an area of two hundred and
seventy acres, inclosed within a wall of brick. Parts of this
wall are still visible, while the rest lies crumbled and
broken.</p>
<p>It is difficult to realize the grand appearance of the thirty
rows of stone columns standing within the wall. Some of them that
are still perfect, are capped with enormous monolith capitals,
and it is said that one hundred men could stand on one of them
without crowding.</p>
<p>The hall itself is four hundred and twenty-two feet long by
one hundred and sixty-five feet broad. The stones of the ceiling

<p>Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions

<p>Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
<a href="http://gutenberg.org/license">http://gutenberg.org/license)</a>.


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS,' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/pglaf.


Section 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive

501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/pglaf

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit:
http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org">http://www.gutenberg.org</a>

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,
are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to
download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular
search system you may utilize the following addresses and just
download by the etext year.

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext06/">http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext06/</a>

    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,
     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)

EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are
filed in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part
of the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is
identical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single
digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For
example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:

http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/1/0/2/3/10234

or filename 24689 would be found at:
http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/2/4/6/8/24689
